# Cutting a release

One file per release in this directory, addressed to somebody who has just
installed that version — what they can now do, and what will still bite them.
See any recent one for the shape; `AGENTS.md` has the rules that govern the
prose, including the one that matters most: **release notes say what is
broken**, about a third of the way down.

This page is the other half — the mechanical part, which until v0.15.1 was
written down nowhere.

## The version lives in six files, and CI only catches two of them

**v0.15.1 was tagged with four of the six updated, and the tag went red.**
`Publish Arch packaging` refused it: `packaging/aur/cordial/PKGBUILD` still said
`pkgver=0.15.0`, and its `source=` pins `#tag=v$pkgver`, so the packaging
repository would have carried the *previous* release under the new version's
name. That check earned its keep; nothing else would have noticed.

| File | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.package] version`) | The one true version. `crates/cordial-shell/src/version.rs` reads it, the window title shows it, `cordial-update` sends it in the User-Agent. A CI gate refuses a tag that disagrees with it. |
| `Cargo.lock` | Holds all five workspace crates' versions. `cargo update --workspace` rewrites them; `cargo metadata` alone does **not**. |
| `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` | The notes. |
| `packaging/aur/cordial/PKGBUILD` (`pkgver`) | Its `source=` pins `#tag=v$pkgver`, so a stale value publishes the wrong release. |
| `packaging/aur/cordial/.SRCINFO` (`pkgver` **and** the `source =` line) | Hand-maintained deliberately — there is no `makepkg` on the development host. Two lines, not one. See [PUBLISHING.md](../../packaging/aur/PUBLISHING.md). |
| `packaging/io.github.luohoa97.Cordial.metainfo.xml` | AppStream shows the newest `<release>` as "what's new", so the top entry is the one that is read. |

`CHANGELOG.md` is **not** in this list. It stops at 0.6.0 by design; everything
from 0.7.0 onward lives here instead.

## Two traps worth knowing before you tag

**`release.yml` has a `paths` filter, and a tag can miss it entirely.** It
builds on `crates/**`, `native/**`, `third_party/**`, `Cargo.lock` and
`Cargo.toml`. A tag placed on a commit already on `main` pushes no new commits,
so nothing matches and no build runs — which left v0.11.0 tagged twice with
nothing built. A release commit that bumps `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` clears
the filter by construction; a tag on an older commit does not.

**Publishing is tag-only.** apt, dnf and pacman publish only when the triggering
run's `head_branch` starts with `v`. A push to `main` builds and is then
deliberately *skipped* by all three publishers — that is the gate working, not a
failure. The Flatpak remote is the exception and still follows `main`, because
its Pages environment carries a deployment branch policy naming `main`; moving
it needs a `v*` policy added there first.

## The order that works

1. Bump the six files; write the notes.
2. Commit, then **check the commit touches what you expect and nothing from a
   submodule**.
3. Tag and push the commit and the tag.
4. Watch `Native packages`, `Flatpak` and `Publish Arch packaging` on the tag.
   The three publishers should run for the tag and skip for `main`.
5. Avoid pushing again to `main` while those are in flight — each push
   supersedes the previous run through its concurrency group, and a runs list
   full of `cancelled` reads exactly like breakage.

If `Publish Arch packaging` does refuse a tag after the fact, fix `pkgver` on
`main` and re-run it with `workflow_dispatch` and the tag as its input: it
checks out the ref it is dispatched on, so a corrected `main` satisfies it
without moving the tag. Moving a published tag is not the answer — workflows are
usually still building against it.
