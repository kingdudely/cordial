# Sign-in — what it would actually take

**Status: §2 and §5 are implemented; the rest is still discovery.** The cookie
persistence §5.2 proposed now exists (`crates/cordial-runtime/src/cookies.rs`,
`native/cookies.cpp`), so a session survives a restart. **§8 records what that
implementation measured, including two places where §5.2 was wrong** — read it
before trusting §5.2's positions. **§9 records the rest of the fix, and with it
that §1.3's central inference was wrong**: the identity mirrors are not
presentation-layer, they are what routes the user, and a restored cookie on its
own leaves you on the landing page. Read §9 before §1.3. Everything about
*obtaining* a session (§3, §4) is unchanged and still discovery.

No credentials were used, entered, or created while writing this document or
implementing §8 and §9. §9's measurements were made against a throwaway account
the owner signed in on an isolated profile, and no account's username, display
name or user id appears anywhere in this repository. This document exists to
turn "there is no sign-in" from a known gap into a scoped, evidence-backed plan.

**Related:** `docs/design/instances-and-launch.md` (a related, independently
written and *not yet verified* theory about a `roblox://` ticket-launch path —
referenced in §4, not duplicated).

## How to read this document

Every claim below is tagged:

- **[verified: log]** — read directly out of `docs/traces/waydroid-roblox-startup.log.gz`,
  the capture of this exact APK running on real Android. This is the strongest
  evidence available in this project, per `docs/NEXT.md`'s standing rule.
- **[verified: dex]** — read directly out of the shipping APK's own dex
  declarations (class names, method names, signatures) using
  `dexsig.py`/`dexsig_cls.py`, or out of `libroblox.so`'s exported symbol table
  with `readelf`. This is the host app's own contract, not a guess about it.
- **[verified: cordial]** — read directly out of Cordial's current source.
- **[inferred]** — a plausible reading of the above that was not itself
  observed running. Flagged explicitly every time, with the reasoning shown so
  it can be checked rather than trusted.

The capture is of a **logged-out** cold start. Absence of some behaviour in it
(no captcha, no full login POST) is not evidence that behaviour doesn't exist
elsewhere in the app — only that this particular run didn't trigger it. Said
again inline wherever it matters.

---

## 1. What does the engine expect?

There are **two separate channels** the engine uses for identity, not one.
Cordial's docstring in `native/android_classes.cpp` only names the first.

### 1.1 `NativeUserJavaInterface` — queried on demand **[verified: cordial]**

`native/android_classes.cpp:225-265` already stubs this correctly for a
logged-out user: `getUserId` → 0, `getUsername`/`getDisplayName`/
`getAlternateName` → `""`, `getIsUnder13` → false, `getMembershipType` → 0,
`getHasRobloxSubscription` → false. The engine calls these when it needs to
know who's signed in (e.g. building a `rbxthumb://` avatar URL), and Cordial's
existing comment is correct that a fabricated non-zero id would be worse than
an honest zero.

### 1.2 `StartAppParams` — pushed once, at app-start time **[verified: cordial]**

`native/init_params.cpp:695-752` defines `com.roblox.engine.jni.autovalue.StartAppParams`,
the object handed to `nativeAppBridgeV2StartAppWithParams` when the engine's
app-shell actually starts. It **already has the fields**:

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<String> username;
jlong appUserId = 0;
jboolean isUnder13 = false;
jint membershipType = 0;
```

All four are currently hard-zeroed in `StartAppParams::Create()`
(`init_params.cpp:730-732`). This is a second, independent place identity has
to be threaded through — it is not automatically consistent with whatever
`NativeUserJavaInterface` answers, because it's a different call at a
different time. Any real implementation has to fill in both.

### 1.3 What would actually be different if these were real

**[verified: log]** The logged-out capture shows the exact symptom the task
description calls out:

```
1338: rbxthumb://type=AvatarHeadShot&id=&w=48&h=48&filters=circular  → "invalid format"
1375: rbxthumb://type=AvatarHeadShot&id=-1&w=48&h=48&filters=circular → "The requested Ids are invalid, of an invalid type or missing."
```

**This is an important correction to the premise in the task description.**
The exact string *"The requested Ids are invalid, of an invalid type or
missing"* is what the **real, logged-out Android client** produces too, for
`id=-1`. It is not a Cordial-specific defect — it is the correct, faithful
behaviour of a client with no signed-in user. Cordial's `getUserId() → 0`
already reproduces the *class* of failure the real client has in this state
(the real client's sentinel appears to be `-1`, not `0` — a one-line, low-risk
alignment worth making so failure messages match exactly, but not
behaviourally different).

**[verified: log]** Also from the capture, three lines up the stack from the
thumbnail failures:

```
1291: HTTP error url: https://apis.roblox.com/attribution/v1/events/post-authentication
1299: HttpResponse ... status:401 ... url: https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/authenticated/app-launch-info
1331: HTTP error body: {"errors":[{"code":9002,"subcode":0,"message":"Authentication token is missing"}]}
1337: HTTP error body: {"sessionId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","status":403,"message":"Unauthorized."}
```

So a real session changes things at the **network layer**, not primarily at
the `NativeUserJavaInterface`/`StartAppParams` layer. The engine calls
`/v1/users/authenticated/app-launch-info` and other `authenticated/*`
endpoints itself, over its own HTTP client, and those calls **succeed or fail
based on the cookie the engine's HTTP client is carrying** — not based on what
`getUserId()` returns. `getUserId()`/`StartAppParams.appUserId` look like they
mirror an already-established server-side session rather than establish one.
**[inferred]** This means the cookie (§2) is the actual source of truth, and
`NativeUserJavaInterface`/`StartAppParams` are secondary, presentation-layer
mirrors of it — filling them in without a real cookie would produce a client
that *displays* a fake identity while still getting 401s from every
`authenticated/*` endpoint, which is worse than the current honest state, not
better.

> **This inference was wrong, and §9 disproves it by running the thing.** The
> half that survives is the warning: filling the mirrors in *without* a real
> cookie would indeed produce a client claiming an account it cannot
> authenticate as, which is why nothing in §9 invents a value. The half that is
> wrong is "presentation-layer". Restore a genuine cookie, confirm the engine
> holds it, and leave the mirrors at zero, and the client still reaches
> `APP_READY (Landing)` — measured on a real signed-in profile. The mirrors are
> not a display of the routing decision, they are an input to it, and so is a
> third call this section did not know about, `nativeSetUserId`. The cookie is
> necessary and was never sufficient.

**[verified: log]** Two more facts from the same run that constrain the
picture:

- `ActivityNativeMain.onResume(): IsLoggedIn = false` and
  `navigateToMainScreen: IsLoggedIn = false` (lines 941, 961) — the real app
  has an explicit `IsLoggedIn` boolean it branches the UI on, checked before
  any of the native calls above run.
- `initializeLuaAppWithLoggedInUser` (line 1031) and `userDidLogin` (line
  1191, an `[FLog::SingleSurfaceApp]` event) both fire **unconditionally**,
  even in this logged-out run. **These names are misleading if read as proof
  of authentication** — they are generic app-shell lifecycle stages the client
  reaches regardless of session state, not evidence that a real login
  happened. Do not treat either as a signal to test against.

---

## 2. Where does the session actually live?

### 2.1 The exported contract **[verified: dex + readelf]**

`com.roblox.engine.jni.NativeSettingsInterface` (all confirmed as real
`Java_com_roblox_engine_jni_NativeSettingsInterface_*` exports in
`libroblox.so`, with signatures read from the dex):

```
nativeGetCookiesForDomain(String) → String
nativeGetCookiesInNetscapeFormat(String) → String
nativeSetMultipleCookies(String, String) → void
nativeSetUserId(String) → void            (not previously documented anywhere in this repo)
nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled() → boolean
```

These are natives **the engine implements and Java calls** — the same
direction as the `nativeSetFilesDirectory`/`nativeSetDeviceInfo` family
Cordial already drives from `native/init_params.cpp` and
`crates/cordial-runtime/src/bin/load.rs`. Nothing here is currently called by
Cordial; grep confirms zero references to any of these five names anywhere in
`native/` or `crates/` before this document.

### 2.2 The reverse direction — the engine pushes cookies out, too

**[verified: dex + readelf]** `com.roblox.universalapp.cookie.JNICookieProtocol.updateOnSetCookieHandler(OnSetCookieHandler)`
is also a real exported native (`Java_..._JNICookieProtocol_updateOnSetCookieHandler`).
The real app's implementation of that handler,
`CookieProtocol$OnSetCookieHandlerImpl.onSetCookie(String[], String)`, is a
**plain Java class** (not a native) — meaning the engine, on receiving a
`Set-Cookie` from its own HTTP client, calls back **into Java** through
whatever handler object was registered.

**[verified: log]** This is directly observed firing, twice, during the
logged-out run:

```
1222: Flushed WebViewCookieHandler with Cookies from URL https://apis.roblox.com/browser-tracker-api/device/initialize
1223: OnSetCookieHandlerImpl.b(): Updated WebViewCookieHandler with Cookies from URL https://apis.roblox.com/browser-tracker-api/device/initialize
1355: Flushed WebViewCookieHandler with Cookies from URL https://apis.roblox.com/account-switcher/v1/getLoggedInUsersMetadata
1356: OnSetCookieHandlerImpl.b(): Updated WebViewCookieHandler with Cookies from URL https://apis.roblox.com/account-switcher/v1/getLoggedInUsersMetadata
```

So the contract has **three** legs, not one, and all three are exercised even
with no user signed in (this traffic is device/tracking cookies, not auth
cookies — but the plumbing is identical for both):

| Direction | Mechanism | Verified how |
|---|---|---|
| Java **pulls** cookies out of the engine | `nativeGetCookiesForDomain`/`nativeGetCookiesInNetscapeFormat` | dex + readelf signatures; `InitHelper: updateCookiesFromEngine` log line (§2.3) |
| Engine **pushes** cookies out to Java | `JNICookieProtocol.updateOnSetCookieHandler` registers a callback; engine `CallMethod`s it | dex + readelf; log lines 1222-1225, 1355-1356 |
| Java **injects** cookies into the engine | `nativeSetMultipleCookies(domain, cookies)` | dex + readelf signature only — not observed firing in this (logged-out, no WebView-login) capture |

**[inferred]** The purpose of this three-way sync: the engine's own HTTP
client and Android's `WebView`/`CookieManager` are two separate cookie jars on
real Android, and the app keeps them consistent so that (a) a cookie the
engine's network layer receives (e.g. after login) is visible to any WebView
the app opens next (communities, captcha, help), and (b) a cookie a WebView
obtains (e.g. the user just typed a password into a login page) is fed back
into the engine so its own HTTP client starts authenticating too. This
explains why `nativeSetMultipleCookies` exists at all — it is the write path
for exactly that second case, and per the task's framing, is the one Cordial
would need to call to hand the engine a real session.

### 2.3 Timing — cookie sync starts before the app shell even exists

**[verified: log]** The earliest cookie-related line in the entire capture is
at `ActivitySplash`, before `ActivityNativeMain` is even created:

```
300: E InitHelper: [l0.S()-160]: updateCookiesFromEngine: Invalid cookie format: []
```

This fires right after crashpad initialization, well before
`nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams`. **[inferred]** The obfuscated caller
(`l0.S()`, logged under the `InitHelper` tag) is almost certainly calling one
of `nativeGetCookiesForDomain`/`nativeGetCookiesInNetscapeFormat` this early
and getting an empty result back (`[]`), which it logs as a format error
rather than treating as fatal — i.e. **calling these natives before the
engine has anything to say is expected and handled gracefully**, not a
precondition Cordial has to satisfy before calling them.

### 2.4 A loose end, flagged rather than resolved

**[verified: readelf, contradicted by dex]** `libroblox.so` also exports
`Java_com_roblox_universalapp_cookie_JNICookieManager_{getCookie,setCookie,setCookiesFromDisk,convertCookiesToNetscape}`
— a *different* class from `JNICookieProtocol`. Searching all three dex files'
raw strings for `JNICookieManager` (not just via `dexsig`, but plain `strings`)
returns **zero matches** — the class does not exist anywhere in this APK's
dex. **[inferred]** This reads as vestigial: an older/renamed native symbol
table entry with no Java-side caller left in this build (native libraries
aren't proguard-stripped the way dex is, so dead exported symbols are
unsurprising). Treat `JNICookieManager` as dead code, not a second live
contract — the three `NativeSettingsInterface` methods plus
`JNICookieProtocol` are the live path.

**Confirmed when §8 was implemented.** Both halves were re-checked
independently: `readelf --dyn-syms` still shows all four
`JNICookieManager_{getCookie,setCookie,setCookiesFromDisk,convertCookiesToNetscape}`
exports, and plain `strings` over all three dex files still returns zero
occurrences of the class name, while `JNICookieProtocol$OnSetCookieHandler`
appears in `classes2.dex` exactly as this section describes. Nothing was built
against `JNICookieManager`, and `setCookiesFromDisk` in particular — which is
the one that sounds like the answer to this whole problem — has no caller and
no disk file to read.

---

## 3. Is a WebView required?

**Short answer: partially yes, and the part that's required is bigger than a
single captcha screen — but the core username/password submission may not be
one of the WebView parts.** Both halves of that are evidenced below; this
refines rather than simply confirms `docs/findings.md` §5(d)/§3.6.

### 3.1 WebView is loaded unconditionally at process start

**[verified: log]** Line 235, well before `ActivityNativeMain` or any login
UI: `WebViewFactory: Loading com.google.android.webview version 150.0.7871.181`.
Android's system WebView is instantiated during ordinary app startup, not
lazily when a login button is pressed. This alone doesn't prove login *needs*
it, but it means "just don't implement WebView" is not free even before
touching sign-in — communities and captcha (below) already depend on it per
the existing framework inventory.

### 3.2 The captcha flow is a URL loaded in a WebView-hosted Activity

**[verified: dex]** `com.roblox.client.captcha.ActivityFunCaptcha` is a
declared Activity (confirmed previously in `framework-api-inventory.md` §3.5).
Its configuration classes resolve to a URL:

```
LoginCaptchaConfig.getUrl() → String
SignUpCaptchaConfig.getUrl() → String
CaptchaConfig.getUrl() → String            (the common base type)
```

A config object that is just a URL, handed to an Activity whose only declared
purpose is captcha, is consistent with loading a challenge page in a WebView
— nothing here contradicts the existing finding that captcha is WebView-based.
This document did not find the internal fragment's layout (obfuscated names
like `H0(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle) → View` don't reveal what view
they inflate without decompiling, which is off-limits per this project's
rules) but the URL-based config plus the WebView's unconditional early load
(§3.1) is corroborating rather than new doubt.

### 3.3 But there's a flag for a non-WebView login path, unexplained in prior docs

**[verified: dex + readelf]** `NativeSettingsInterface.nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled() → boolean`
is a real native. **[inferred]** Roblox's app shell (the "Landing", "Startup"
etc. stages visible throughout the capture) is rendered by the Lua-based
`SingleSurfaceApp`/`UniversalApp`, the same layer that renders the rest of the
UI without a WebView. A flag named `IsLuaLoginEnabled` reads most naturally as
"is the login *form* (username/password fields) rendered by the Lua app shell
rather than a WebView", talking to `auth.roblox.com` (DNS for which is
pre-warmed at startup — line 103: `Pre-warmed DNS for auth.roblox.com`)
directly over HTTPS, which Cordial already supports end-to-end.

If that reading is right, **basic username/password login may not require a
WebView at all** — only the captcha challenge and any federated (Google/Apple)
sign-in option would. This is not verified by running anything (the captured
run never reached a login screen), so treat it as the single most valuable
thing to confirm early if this work is picked up: instrument
`nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled`'s return value and see whether the login form that
appears is native/Lua or a WebView.

### 3.4 The honest expectation regardless

**[inferred]** Roblox's captcha is risk-based and server-decided, not
something the client can predict or skip. A Linux host presenting as a
brand-new, unrecognized Android x86_64 device is close to the profile that
triggers step-up challenges most often. So even if password submission itself
turns out to be WebView-free, **a real user attempting to actually sign in
through Cordial should be expected to hit `ActivityFunCaptcha` on a first
attempt**, and a WebView implementation should be budgeted for, not treated as
optional-in-practice. This matches — and does not overturn —
`framework-api-inventory.md`'s conclusion that WebView "is also on the login
path... not optional."

---

## 4. Is there a path that avoids it?

Three non-web-form surfaces are declared in the APK. None of them turned out
to be a low-effort shortcut on inspection — stated plainly, since that's the
honest answer to the question asked.

### 4.1 Passkeys / `CredentialManager` — already scoped, still large

Covered in depth by `framework-api-inventory.md` §3.6 already: the platform
`android.credentials.CredentialManager` path is real and avoids GMS, but
still means implementing the platform credential-provider contract and
bridging to `libfido2`/`xdg-desktop-portal` — not smaller than WebView, just a
different large piece of work. Nothing new found here; not re-litigated.

### 4.2 "Magic Login" — local-network device pairing, genuinely non-web, unverified in operation

**[verified: dex strings]** Distinct from `JNIAccountProtocol`'s
`getMagicLoginActionKey`/`getMagicLoginMethodName` (small JS-bridge-style
constant getters, same pattern as `FlagJniInterface`), the dex contains a
cluster of unrelated-looking class names:

```
MagicLoginManager
MagicLoginNsdHelperClient / MagicLoginNsdHelperServer
MagicLoginSocketHelperClient / MagicLoginSocketHelperServer
MagicLoginSocketTimeout
Roblox-Magic-Login          (an HTTP header name)
```

**[inferred]** `Nsd` is Android's Network Service Discovery (mDNS) API. This
shape — an NSD advertise/discover pair plus a raw socket helper plus an HTTP
header — reads as a **"sign in using another device that's already logged
in"** flow: an already-authenticated device (e.g. the user's phone) advertises
on the LAN, a new device discovers it and exchanges a session over the local
socket, likely with a server-mediated confirmation (the HTTP header suggests
a request is also sent to Roblox's servers as part of the handshake). This is
the shape of the "sign in with your phone" flow real Roblox ships on
console/TV-class clients.

**This would let Cordial obtain a real session without ever presenting a
password field or a WebView itself** — the credential entry happens on the
peer device, which the user already trusts. It is the most promising
non-WebView lead this investigation found.

**Caveat, stated as strongly as the evidence deserves:** this was found by
`strings`-grepping obfuscated class names in a dex, not by observing it run.
The logged-out capture never triggers this flow (there is no reason it would,
on a cold start), so nothing here confirms it actually works, what the wire
protocol is, or whether it's gated behind a flag/feature that's off in this
build. It needs its own investigation — likely by triggering it on a real
device and capturing the traffic — before it can be relied on for a design.

### 4.3 The `roblox://` launch-ticket path — a different document's open question, not resolved here

`docs/design/instances-and-launch.md` §2 already describes (and explicitly
flags as **unverified**) a theory that pressing "Play" on roblox.com in an
external browser emits a `roblox://`-scheme URI carrying a short-lived
authentication ticket, and that `ActivityProtocolLaunch` consuming it is what
lets multiple Cordial instances each be signed in as a different account
without Cordial ever touching credentials.

**[verified: dex strings]** What this document found narrows that: the
`roblox://` URIs actually declared in the dex are all **game-join** shaped —
`roblox://placeId=%d&reservedServerAccessCode=%s&callId=%s`,
`roblox://experiences/start`, `roblox://placeId=%d&gameInstanceId=%s&callId=%s`
— not a bare authentication URI. `ActivityProtocolLaunch`'s own methods
(`i2(String) → boolean`, `j2() → void`) give no further signature detail
without decompiling.

**[inferred]** This is more consistent with the classic Roblox desktop-client
"join ticket" — scoped to launching into one specific place/server, minted by
a browser session that is *already* fully authenticated — than with a
general-purpose account sign-in mechanism. It may still be genuinely useful
(a join ticket plausibly carries enough for the client to also treat itself as
signed in as that account for the session, which is `instances-and-launch.md`'s
working theory), but this document did not find evidence settling whether a
join ticket alone produces a durable, reusable `.ROBLOSECURITY`-equivalent
cookie, or only an ephemeral per-join credential. **This is the same open
question `instances-and-launch.md` §8 already lists** ("verify the `roblox://`
URI format and whether tickets are genuinely single-use and session-scoped")
— this investigation corroborates that it's worth answering, without
answering it.

### 4.4 Verdict on §4

No path was found that is both (a) confirmed to work and (b) avoids either a
WebView or a second physical/logical device. If forced to rank by plausible
effort: §4.2 (magic login) is the cheapest **if** it turns out to work as
inferred, §4.3 (join ticket) is worth resolving because another design
already depends on it, and §4.1 (passkeys) is real but not small. None of
these should be assumed as the plan without running something first — every
one of them is currently a string in a dex, not an observed behaviour.

---

## 5. What is the minimum viable step, if a real session existed?

This section assumes a real `.ROBLOSECURITY`-style session cookie has been
obtained by some means outside Cordial (e.g. a real browser login performed
by the user, independent of Cordial itself — consistent with `instances-and-launch.md`
§7's "Cordial stores no credentials" stance) and asks what the smallest change
to Cordial would be to make the engine actually use it. It does **not**
propose building any login UI.

### 5.1 The existing call order, and where the new calls slot in

**[verified: cordial]** `crates/cordial-runtime/src/bin/load.rs` already
drives this exact sequence (line numbers as of this session):

```
NativeSettingsInterface.nativeSetFilesDirectory / nativeSetCacheDirectory /
  nativeSetExternalDirectory / nativeSetBaseDataDirectories        (~652-669)
MainGameActivity.nativeSetAssetPath                                 (~676)
NativeSettingsInterface.nativeSetRobloxVersion / nativeSetRobloxChannel (~681,690)
NativeSettingsInterface.nativeSetDeviceInfo                         (~699)
MainGameActivity.nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams                       (~766)
  ...
MainGameActivity.nativePreloadFlagOverrides                         (~957)
MainGameActivity.nativeRetryInit                                    (~1001)
NativeGLInterface.nativeAppBridgeV2InitWithParams                   (~1071)
NativeGLInterface.nativeAppBridgeStartLuaAppDM                      (~1082)
NativeGLInterface.nativeAppBridgeV2StartAppWithParams                (~1116)
```

### 5.2 The concrete proposal

1. **Call `NativeSettingsInterface.nativeSetMultipleCookies(domain, cookies)`
   once the real cookie is available**, before `nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams`
   (~766) — so the engine's own HTTP client is carrying the session before
   the app-bridge sequence that will immediately start hitting
   `authenticated/*` endpoints (§1.3) begins. `nativeSetUserId(String)`
   (§2.1, previously undocumented) should be called in the same neighborhood
   — its exact required timing relative to the cookie call is **not verified**
   and would need to be checked against behaviour, not assumed.

   > **Corrected by measurement — see §8.** The position named here is wrong.
   > Called before `nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams` the native returns cleanly
   > and stores nothing at all; the engine's cookie jar does not exist until
   > `nativeAppBridgeV2InitWithParams` has built it. The *reasoning* was right
   > and is preserved by the corrected position, which is immediately after
   > that call and still before `StartLuaAppDM`.
2. **Register a real `OnSetCookieHandler`** via
   `JNICookieProtocol.updateOnSetCookieHandler` (§2.2) so cookies the engine's
   own HTTP client subsequently receives (e.g. a session refresh) are
   observed rather than silently dropped — this is the callback direction
   Cordial has no equivalent of yet, structurally the same shape as the
   existing `NativeHelper::gameActivity_onFlagsFailed` callback pattern
   already used in `native/android_classes.cpp`.
3. **Fill in `StartAppParams`** (`init_params.cpp:730-732`) — `appUserId`,
   `username`, `isUnder13`, `membershipType` — from the same real account,
   right before `nativeAppBridgeV2StartAppWithParams` (~1116).
4. **Fill in `NativeUserJavaInterface`** (`android_classes.cpp:227-250`) —
   `getUserId`, `getUsername`, `getDisplayName`, `getMembershipType`,
   `getHasRobloxSubscription`, `getIsUnder13` — consistently with the same
   account, since the engine can call these at any later point and a mismatch
   with what `StartAppParams` said would be a self-contradicting client.
5. **Verify against the log, not by assumption**: rerun with
   `CORDIAL_MONITOR=1`, capture the engine's own FastLog
   (`$CORDIAL_FILES_DIR/files/appData/logs/*.log` per the project's standing
   diagnostic), and check that `authenticated/*` calls now return 200 instead
   of the 401/403 pattern in §1.3, and that the two `rbxthumb://` failures in
   §1.3 are replaced by a real avatar id.

Nothing in steps 1-4 requires new JNI plumbing beyond what already exists in
`native/init_params.cpp`'s `cordial_call_static_strings`/`cordial_call_bare`
helper family (§2.1's natives all fit the "static native, up to three string
args" shape those helpers already handle) plus one new callback registration
(step 2) shaped like the existing `NativeHelper` pattern. This is a
small, mechanical change **conditioned entirely on having a real cookie to
put in it** — which is the actual blocker, per §4.

---

## 6. Summary

| Question | Answer | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| What does the engine expect differently when logged in? | **Three** things, all required: a real cookie in the engine's HTTP client, the two identity mirrors (`NativeUserJavaInterface`, `StartAppParams`), and `NativeSettingsInterface.nativeSetUserId`. This row used to say the mirrors were secondary; §9 measured all three and any one missing leaves the client on `Landing`. | Verified (live run, with a control) for all three. |
| Where does the session live? | Three-way cookie sync between the engine's HTTP client and Android's WebView `CookieManager`, via `NativeSettingsInterface`'s three cookie natives plus `JNICookieProtocol`'s callback. | Verified (dex, readelf, log) for the contract shape; `nativeSetMultipleCookies` itself was not observed firing. |
| Is a WebView required? | For captcha: yes, and expect it to fire in practice — even a native (`CaptchaNative`) captcha screen was found, so this stays unsettled but the WebView path still needs building regardless (§7.5). For plain username/password: **no** — `FIntLuaAppLoginMethod` (default `"1"`) makes this Lua-rendered by default, confirmed by calling the engine's own native directly and by a `LoginNative` screen with real username/password copy shipped in the app's own content (§7). | Captcha: verified-adjacent, refined but not overturned. Password path: **verified**, resolved from §3.3's "possibly not, unconfirmed." |
| Is there a path that avoids it? | No confirmed one. Local-device "magic login" is the most promising unverified lead; a join-ticket path already assumed by another design doc remains unresolved. | Inferred, both. |
| What's the minimum viable step? | Five mechanical calls into existing/adjacent JNI plumbing, entirely gated on obtaining a real cookie by some means outside Cordial. | Verified for the mechanics; the precondition (§4) is the real blocker. |

**The one thing this document changes about the project's understanding of
its own blocker:** it is not "Cordial has no auth." It is "Cordial has no way
to *obtain* a session, and every way of obtaining one that was found requires
either a WebView, a second device, or an unresolved ticket flow."

The sentence that used to follow — "the stub code in `NativeUserJavaInterface`
is not the blocker" — **was wrong, and it was wrong in the expensive direction.**
It was honestly reporting a true fact, and it was also the thing keeping a
signed-in user on the landing page after the cookie work landed. §9.

## 7. Resolving §3.3: does `nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled` mean login can skip a WebView?

§3.3 above flagged `NativeSettingsInterface.nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled()` as the
single most valuable open question, unresolved because the logged-out capture
never reaches a login screen. This section answers it by tracing the dex
bytecode that consumes the native's return value, isolating the exact
FastFlag that controls it, and running Cordial with and against that flag —
a real control, not a guess.

No account was created, no credentials were entered, and nothing here typed
into or submitted a login form.

### 7.1 What `nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled` actually gates **[verified: dex bytecode]**

The dex declares the native (as §2.1 already established), but nothing in
this project had previously traced who calls it or what branches on the
result. Disassembling the dex directly (via `androguard`, reading actual
instructions rather than inferring from names) settles both:

```
Luk/c; a ()Z
  invoke-static Luk/c;->b()Z        ; b() just calls the native and returns it
  move-result v0
  if-nez v0, +0bh                   ; if native said true -> return true
  invoke-static Lel/s;->i()Z        ; else check a second condition...
  move-result v0
  if-eqz v0, +003h
  goto +3h
  const/4 v0, 0
  return v0
  const/4 v0, 1
  return v0

Lel/s; i ()Z
  const/4 v0, 0
  return v0                         ; ...which is hard-coded to `false` in this build
```

So `uk.c.a()` — the actual gate everything else calls — reduces to exactly
`nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled()` in this shipping build; the second disjunct is
dead weight (a debug/staging override compiled out here).

`uk.c.a()` has exactly two callers in the whole APK, both `handleNotification()`-style
methods on Activity subclasses sharing a common base (`com/roblox/client/a`),
both handling the **logout event** (`code == 101`):

- `com.roblox.client.ActivityNativeMain.V(int, Bundle)`
- `com.roblox.client.RobloxWebActivity.V(int, Bundle)`

In both, when `uk.c.a()` is true, the handler additionally:

1. Sets a one-shot static flag (`tj.b.p()` → `Ltj/b;->e = true`), and
2. Spins up an `AsyncTask` (`ActivityNativeMain$l`) that checks whether the
   engine's rendering `Surface` is still alive and, if so, **reuses it**
   (`Vi/e.w`/`Vi/e.x`) instead of tearing it down.

That one-shot flag is consumed later, in `ActivityNativeMain.e0()` — the
handler for the engine's own `onAppStarted` callback — via `tj.b.e()` (a
read-and-clear getter), which re-triggers the same surface-reuse task once
the Lua app shell reports it has restarted.

**What this means:** `nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled` does not gate "render form A
vs form B" directly. It gates a **logout → re-entry rendering-continuity
optimization**: when true, the app keeps its OpenGL rendering surface warm
across a logout and hands it straight back to the restarting Lua app shell,
instead of tearing the surface down and rebuilding it. That behaviour only
makes sense if whatever the user lands on next — the post-logout
landing/login screen — is rendered inside that same Lua/GL surface rather
than by launching a separate WebView-hosting Activity. It is corroborating
evidence for the Lua-login reading, not the direct proof §3.3 was hoping for;
§7.4 below supplies the direct proof.

### 7.2 Which FastFlag controls it, isolated by bisection **[verified: cordial, live run]**

Searching the client-settings document (`clientsettings.orig.json`, a
previously-captured copy) for anything matching `*Login*` and `*Lua*Login*`
turns up ten plausible-looking candidates, none named exactly
`IsLuaLoginEnabled`:

```
FFlagEnableLuaLoginRevamp6 = True
FFlagEnableLuaLoginRevamp8 = True
FFlagLuaAppUsingSecurityQuestionsForLuaLogin2 = True
FFlagDisableAndroidLogInReleaseBuilds_IXP = "1;...;flagbank"   (an IXP bucket string, not a plain bool)
FIntLuaAppLoginMethod = "1"
FIntLuaAppLoginRollout = "100"
FIntLuaLoginGenderSelector = "1"
```

`strings` on `libroblox.so` finds only the exported symbol name itself
(`Java_com_roblox_engine_jni_NativeSettingsInterface_nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled`)
— no flag-name string literal near it, so which flag the native actually
reads could not be settled by inspection. It had to be settled by running it.

**Instrumentation added** (uncommitted, in this worktree only): a new
zero-argument `boolean`-returning JNI call helper —
`cordial_call_static_bare_bool` in `native/init_params.cpp`, wired through
`crates/cordial-linker-sys/src/lib.rs` as `call_static_bare_bool`, invoked
once in `crates/cordial-runtime/src/bin/load.rs` right after flags and
client settings have both been delivered to the engine. It calls
`NativeSettingsInterface.nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled()` directly and prints the
result — `[sign-in probe] nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled() -> <bool>` — nothing
else. This does not drive any UI and does not run any dex/Java bytecode
(Cordial doesn't execute the APK's dex at all — see the caveat in §7.3); it
only reads the engine's own boolean answer.

**A methodology note, for anyone re-running this:** the worktree this was
run from predated `crates/cordial-runtime/src/flags.rs` (the flags-to-client-settings
merge pipeline described in that file's own doc comment as "the mechanism
that demonstrably works," with its own independently-verified control using
`DFFlagRbxTransportUseRtcioRna`). That file, plus the four-line change to
`client_settings.rs` that calls it, existed already on `main` but not on this
branch, so a first attempt at "set a flag in `flags.json` and see if anything
changes" produced two identical `true` results — not because the flag has no
effect, but because the file was being silently ignored by a binary that had
no merge step at all. Once `flags.rs` and the matching `client_settings.rs`
hunk were carried over (uncommitted; both already exist verbatim on `main`,
this only makes this branch's binary match it) and `serde_json` added to
`cordial-runtime`'s `Cargo.toml`, the pipeline worked and gave the results
below. This is exactly the kind of gap the task's own warning about
disassembly-derived conclusions is trying to prevent — the fix was to notice
the run wasn't testing what it claimed to, not to trust the first "no
effect" result.

**Control, then bisection**, each a full `cordial-run --run 25` under
`CORDIAL_MONITOR=1`, reading `[sign-in probe]` from stdout:

| `~/.config/cordial/flags.json` | `nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled()` |
|---|---|
| absent (control) | **true** |
| all 10 candidates forced off/0 | **false** |
| the 5 real `FFlag*`/IXP candidates only | true (no change) |
| the other 5 (3 guessed-name flags + 2 `FInt*`) | **false** |
| just the 3 guessed-name flags (`FFlagIsLuaLoginEnabled`, `FFlagLuaLoginEnabled`, `DFFlagIsLuaLoginEnabled` — none of which exist in the real client-settings document, so these are pure no-ops that happen to get merged in as new, unread keys) | true (no change) |
| just `FIntLuaAppLoginMethod=0` + `FIntLuaAppLoginRollout=0` | **false** |
| just `FIntLuaAppLoginMethod=0` alone | **false** |
| just `FIntLuaAppLoginRollout=0` alone (Method left at its default `1`) | true (no change) |

**Isolated result: `FIntLuaAppLoginMethod` is the controlling flag.** Its
shipped default is `"1"`, which is why the honest, un-overridden control run
already returns `true` — **Lua login is the default in this build**, not
something that needs turning on. Setting it to `0` reproducibly flips
`nativeIsLuaLoginEnabled()` to `false`. `FIntLuaAppLoginRollout` (a
percentage-shaped name, default `"100"`) does not independently affect it —
consistent with it being a server-side experiment-allocation knob rather
than something the client itself branches on directly. None of
`FFlagEnableLuaLoginRevamp6`/`8`, `FFlagLuaAppUsingSecurityQuestionsForLuaLogin2`,
or `FFlagDisableAndroidLogInReleaseBuilds_IXP` — despite all sounding
relevant by name — moved this particular native at all; they likely gate
sub-features of the Lua login *experience* (a UI "revamp," a security-questions
step) rather than the native/WebView choice itself. Ruling those out by
running them, rather than assuming from the name, is itself a finding.

### 7.3 The honest limit of what "observe" could mean here **[verified: cordial]**

The task asked to turn the flag and *observe*, meaning: see whether the
rendered UI changes. It doesn't, not yet, and here is exactly why: **Cordial
does not execute the APK's dex bytecode.** Everything this section traced in
§7.1 — `uk.c.a()`, `ActivityNativeMain.V`, `RobloxWebActivity.V`, `tj.b` —
is Java code that runs on Android's ART VM. Cordial only loads
`libroblox.so` natively and drives its exported entry points directly from
Rust/C++, standing in for the Java caller by hand (exactly the pattern
`cordial_call_static_strings` and friends already use, and the one this
section's new `cordial_call_static_bare_bool` also uses). There is no ART,
so there is no code path that would ever call `uk.c.a()`, branch on it, or
show a login screen as a consequence — regardless of what the native
answers.

So what was actually verified is narrower than "the UI changes": it is that
**the engine's own native call, invoked directly and read directly, answers
`true` by default and can be flipped to `false` by a specific, isolated,
real FastFlag** — a fully mechanical fact about the shipped binary,
independent of any UI. Whether flipping it would visibly change a rendered
screen is not something Cordial can currently observe, because Cordial has
no login-launching UI of its own yet and no dex execution to drive the real
one. That gap is orthogonal to this question and unchanged by this
investigation.

### 7.4 Is there a Lua-rendered login UI in the shipped content? Yes — directly, not just inferred **[verified: rbxm strings]**

`assets/ExtraContent/models/UniversalApp/UniversalApp.rbxm` — part of the
Lua app shell's own content, extracted from the APK — is a Roblox binary
file (`<roblox!` header, zstd-compressed chunks). Decompressing its chunks
(a from-scratch reader was needed; no existing tool in the environment
handles this format, and `androguard`/binary-format libraries don't apply to
it) and running `strings` over the ~46 MB decompressed property chunk finds
a **complete, multi-language localization table for a full authentication
UI**, including, among many others:

```
Authentication.Login.Heading.Login
Authentication.Login.Label.Username
Authentication.Login.Label.Password
Authentication.Login.Label.Email
Authentication.Login.Label.UsernameEmailOrPhoneNumber
Authentication.Login.Label.UsernameEmailPhone
Authentication.Login.Action.Next
Authentication.Login.Action.LogInEmailOneTimeCode
Authentication.Login.Action.SendVerificationEmail
Authentication.Login.Description.PasskeyDescription
Authentication.Login.LinkIllegalChildAccountLinking   (mentions a QR code)
Authentication.CrossDevice.Label.LoginInstructions
Authentication.CrossDevice.Label.ConfirmAndLoginAs
Authentication.CrossDevice.Response.LoginSuccess
```

translated into at least French, Turkish, Italian, Polish, Spanish, and a
China-specific "Luobu"-branded variant. `Authentication.CrossDevice.*`
independently corroborates §4.2's "magic login" lead (an already-signed-in
device confirming a login for a new one) with real shipped copy, not just
suggestively-named dex classes.

More directly still, the same file contains what reads as the app shell's
own registry of named, navigable screens — a flat array of Pascal-style
strings, one screen name each:

```
...SinglePageSignUp MultiPageSignup LuobuSignUpPage Landing Birthday
LoginNative CaptchaNative ViewFriends SearchUsers ShareSheet SdkShare
ReportAbuse ReportScreen AddFriendsPage ConnectionsHub CoHubMyConnections
CoHubAddConnections ScanQrCode GenericOpaqueWebPage ChallengeHybridOverlayPage
ChallengeHybridWebView PhoneVerification EditUsername PassesPage ...
```

`LoginNative` is a real, first-class screen name the app shell's own
navigation system recognises — and it is the *only* login-shaped screen name
anywhere in this file; `LoginWeb`, `LoginWebView`, and `WebViewLogin` all
return zero matches. Screens that genuinely are WebView-hosted are named
accordingly right alongside it in the same list —
`GenericWebPage`/`GenericOpaqueWebPage`, `AddFriendsWebView`,
`ChallengeHybridWebView` — which is good corroboration that this naming
convention is real and consistently applied, not incidental.

This directly confirms the premise §3.3 could only infer: **the shipped Lua
app shell has its own native login screen, `LoginNative`, with full
username/password copy, and it is a named peer of screens that really are
WebView-hosted, distinguished by the same naming convention.** Combined with
§7.2 (Lua login is the shipped default) and §7.1 (the logout path's own
surface-continuity behaviour assumes the next screen is Lua-rendered), the
three independent lines of evidence now agree.

**Caveat:** finding the string `LoginNative` in a screen-name enum proves the
screen is defined and named, not that it is reachable, wired up, or free of
its own dependency on WebView-hosted sub-flows once inside it (e.g. a "log
in with Google" button on that screen could still open a WebView without
that changing the screen's own name or its username/password fields). No
navigation into any screen was attempted — that would require pressing UI
elements this task's constraints put out of scope for anything past
observation.

### 7.5 Does captcha still block it? Narrowed, not settled — and one part cuts against the convenient answer **[verified: rbxm strings]**

The same screen-name list contains `CaptchaNative` immediately next to
`LoginNative` — a native-rendered captcha screen, distinct from the
WebView-shaped `ChallengeHybridWebView`/`ChallengeHybridOverlayPage` entries
in the same list (which read as the natural landing spot for
`ActivityFunCaptcha`'s URL-based `LoginCaptchaConfig`/`SignUpCaptchaConfig`,
per §3.2). Both `LoginNative` and `CaptchaNative` occur exactly once in the
file — as enum entries only; no second reference to either was found, so
there is no evidence here of which triggers when, or that `CaptchaNative` is
actually wired to anything live.

**The part that cuts against the convenient reading:** the same file also
contains `Turnstile`/`turnstile` (Cloudflare's captcha widget) and
`CaptchaV2`/`captchav2` strings. Turnstile is, in every other context it
ships in, a web/JS widget — its presence alongside `CaptchaNative` reads
more like "this build supports more than one captcha backend, selected
server-side by risk assessment" than "captcha has moved off WebView." This
document already said (§3.4) that captcha is risk-based and server-decided,
not something the client predicts — that stands. `CaptchaNative`'s existence
is real and new, and worth someone confirming by actually reaching a captcha
challenge on a real account, but it does not license "a WebView is no longer
needed for captcha." **A WebView implementation should still be budgeted
for.**

### 7.6 What this changes

- **§3.3's open question is now answered, not just narrowed:** plain
  username/password login is Lua-rendered by default in this shipped build
  (`FIntLuaAppLoginMethod = "1"`), the engine's own native agrees when called
  directly, and the shipped Lua content itself independently confirms a
  `LoginNative` screen exists with full username/password copy. §3.3's
  "possibly not" becomes "verified: no, not for the base form."
- **What is still true and unchanged:** §3.2's WebView-based captcha finding
  stands; §7.5 adds a native captcha screen to the picture without replacing
  it. §4's verdict (no confirmed WebView-free *path to a session*, i.e. §2's
  actual blocker) is untouched — this section is about what renders the
  form, not about how Cordial would obtain a real cookie, which remains the
  real blocker per §4 and §6.
- **What is newly true and worth carrying forward:** if a login-driving UI
  is ever built in Cordial, the rendering-technology question that used to
  gate the whole plan (embed a browser, yes or no) has a real, verified
  answer for the base form: **no, not for username/password entry itself.**
  A WebView is still very likely needed somewhere in the full flow (captcha
  most likely, federated/passkey login certainly), so it is not removed as a
  dependency of the project — but it is no longer required to render the
  first, most common screen a user would see.

## 8. Implemented: the session now survives a restart

§5.2 was written as a plan conditioned on "having a real cookie to put in it".
That condition was met — the owner signed in via Quick Sign-in — and the plan
was implemented. Two of its five steps turned out to be wrong in ways that
produced a working call and an empty jar, which is exactly the failure mode
this document's own §7.2 methodology note warns about, so both are recorded
here rather than only fixed in code.

No account was created and no credentials were entered while establishing any
of this. Every measurement below used a marker cookie with an obviously fake
value, in a scratch profile under a scratch `XDG_DATA_HOME`.

### 8.1 The problem was never a shutdown flush **[verified: measurement]**

The engine **never writes its cookies to disk**. A complete
`CORDIAL_TRACE_PATHS=1` inventory of every non-system file it opens contains no
cookie jar and no credential store; `grep -rl ROBLOSECURITY` over real profile
trees finds nothing. §2.2's three-way sync is the whole mechanism, and on
Android the persistence leg is Java's — `OnSetCookieHandlerImpl` in the capture.
Cordial has no Java side, so nothing persisted anything.

This was controlled for rather than assumed: alternating killed and graceful
runs, two passes, produced no file created or updated at shutdown that a killed
run does not also produce. The graceful teardown descent (`looper.rs`) is real,
works, and was never the missing piece.

### 8.2 The natives do nothing until the app bridge exists **[verified: live run]**

§5.2 step 1 says to call `nativeSetMultipleCookies` before
`nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams`. `CORDIAL_COOKIE_PROBE=1` sets a marker cookie
and reads it straight back at four points in the startup sequence:

| Point in `load.rs` | marker read back |
|---|---|
| before `nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams` (§5.2's position) | **0 bytes** |
| after `nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams` | **0 bytes** |
| after `nativeAppBridgeV2InitWithParams` | **51 bytes** |
| after `nativeAppBridgeStartLuaAppDM` | 51 bytes |
| at teardown | 51 bytes |

The call returns success at every one of these. Nothing distinguishes the two
that do nothing from the three that work except reading the jar back, which is
why the restore path now does exactly that on every launch. The restore was
moved to immediately after `nativeAppBridgeV2InitWithParams`, which preserves
§5.2's actual requirement — it is still before `StartLuaAppDM`, and so before
the app shell issues its first `authenticated/*` request.

### 8.3 The getter and the setter are not mirrors **[verified: live run]**

`nativeSetMultipleCookies` takes `name=value` pairs, a `Cookie:` header.
`nativeGetCookiesForDomain` does **not** return that shape. Feeding the getter's
output straight back is accepted silently and leaves the engine holding nothing:
51 bytes written, 0 bytes in the jar afterwards.

The getter's format was established by planting two cookies of known name and
value length and counting separators — never by printing a jar. Three cookies
come back as nineteen tab-separated fields of widths
`[21, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 27, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6, 29, 4, 1, 5, 1, 12, 1]`, which resolves
uniquely to Netscape `cookies.txt` records —

```text
#HttpOnly_.roblox.com <TAB> TRUE <TAB> / <TAB> FALSE <TAB> 0 <TAB> NAME <TAB> VALUE
```

— joined by `"; "` rather than by a newline. The 21-wide field is
`#HttpOnly_.roblox.com`; the `4/1/5/1` run is `TRUE`, `/`, `FALSE`, `0`; the 4-,
6- and 12-wide fields are the three planted names; and the 27- and 29-wide
fields are a value glued to the next record's domain across the two-character
separator (4+2+21, 6+2+21). `cookies.rs`'s `to_settable` is the conversion, and
the store holds the converted form so that a restore is a straight hand-over.

This is also why `nativeGetCookiesInNetscapeFormat` exists as a separate
entry point and is not needed here.

### 8.4 What is verified, and what is not

**Verified, over five consecutive runs plus a disabled control:** a jar read out
of the engine, converted, written to `<profile>/cookies` at `0600` by temporary
file and rename — which is where it went then and is now only the fallback; see
§10 — restored on the next launch, and confirmed present by reading
the engine's jar back afterwards. With `CORDIAL_SKIP_COOKIES=1` — same binary,
same profile — nothing is restored, nothing is saved, and the store is byte-for-byte
untouched.

**INFERRED, and deliberately not depended on:** the `JNICookieProtocol`
`OnSetCookieHandler` callback (§2.2, §5.2 step 2). It is registered, and
`--dump-classes` shows the nested class and `onSetCookie` present where before
this change no cookie class appeared at all. But it has **never been observed
firing under Cordial**: over every run here the sink was called zero times,
while the engine's own log showed it reaching the network and collecting the
401s §1.3 documents. The capture's cookie traffic comes from requests Roblox's
*Java* code issues, and Cordial runs no dex. The dump reports `onSetCookie`
under two descriptors, so it does not settle which one the engine would resolve
either. The session is therefore saved by reading the jar back on a thirty-second
timer and at teardown, which needs no callback; if the callback does fire it
only makes those saves prompt.

**Out of scope when §8 was written, and done in §9:** §5.2 steps 3 and 4
(`StartAppParams` and `NativeUserJavaInterface`). This paragraph used to say
"§1.3's finding stands — those are presentation-layer mirrors, and the cookie is
what unblocks `authenticated/*`", and then that whether they needed filling in
was answerable only against a genuinely signed-in run. The second half was
right and the first half was wrong: the signed-in run happened, and the answer
is that the mirrors decide the route. §9.

---

## 9. Implemented: the restored session now signs you in

§8 made a session survive a restart and the user was still on the landing page.
This section is why, and it overturns §1.3.

Every measurement below was made on a throwaway account, on an isolated profile
under its own `XDG_DATA_HOME`, signed in by the owner. **No credentials were
entered and no account's username, display name or user id appears in this
document, in any commit, or in any test fixture.** Where a value would be the
evidence, its length or its presence is given instead — the same discipline
`cookies.rs` already keeps for a jar.

### 9.1 The cookie is necessary and was never sufficient **[verified: live run]**

The starting position, on a profile with a real signed-in cookie store:

```text
  [cookies] .roblox.com: engine holds 5 cookie(s) after restore
  [cookies] apis.roblox.com: engine holds 5 cookie(s) after restore
  [cookies] auth.roblox.com: engine holds 5 cookie(s) after restore
  [cookies] roblox.com: engine holds 5 cookie(s) after restore
  [cookies] restored 4 domain(s)
[roblox] app ready: PlatformAccountRouter
[roblox] app ready: Startup
[roblox] app ready: Landing
```

The engine has the session, confirms it by reading its own jar back, and routes
to the landing page anyway. §1.3 predicted the opposite.

### 9.2 The engine hands over the identity, and Cordial was dropping it **[verified: live run]**

`onDataModelNotificationCallback` — already hooked, and already the thing that
prints `[roblox] datamodel notification:` — carries it. From the owner's own
sign-in, values elided:

```text
onDataModelNotification: Received type(DID_LOG_IN, 28), data({"username":…,
  "membershipType":0,"isUnder13":false,"hasRobloxSubscription":false,
  "countryCode":…,"userId":…,"displayName":…})
onDataModelNotification: Received type(APP_READY, 10), data(Home)
```

Those are exactly the fields §1.2 lists as hard-zeroed in `StartAppParams` and
§1.1 lists as stubbed in `NativeUserJavaInterface`. Before this change,
`grep -rn DID_LOG_IN` over the whole repository returned nothing: Cordial
received it, printed it in full, and dropped it. **Printing it in full was also
a privacy defect** — a real person's username and user id went to stderr on
every sign-in — and that line now reports the payload's size and nothing else.

`DID_LOG_OUT` and `LUA_UNAUTHORIZED_LOG_OUT` clear the stored identity.
`DID_SIGN_UP` and `DID_SWITCH_ACCOUNT` are routed through the same parse.
**Those four are INFERRED**: they are strings in `libroblox.so` next to
`DID_LOG_IN`, `POST_PURCHASE` and `UNREAD_COUNT`, and none has been observed
firing under Cordial, because reaching any of them needs a click. The parse
stores nothing that is not identity-shaped, so a wrong guess about the payload
of one of them is a no-op rather than a wrong account.

### 9.3 Filling the two mirrors in is still not enough **[verified: live run, with a probe]**

With the identity restored into both mirrors, the client still reached
`Landing`. `CORDIAL_TRACE_IDENTITY=1` — which names the field asked and whether
anybody is signed in, and never the value — settles that the engine does ask:

```text
      4 [cordial] identity asked: getDisplayName (signed in)
      4 [cordial] identity asked: getHasRobloxSubscription (signed in)
      4 [cordial] identity asked: getIsUnder13 (signed in)
      4 [cordial] identity asked: getMembershipType (signed in)
      4 [cordial] identity asked: getUserId (signed in)
      4 [cordial] identity asked: getUsername (signed in)
[roblox] app ready: Landing
```

That probe exists because "the engine never asked" and "the engine asked and
routed on something else" are completely different pieces of work with the same
symptom, and the symptom is a landing page.

### 9.4 The third leg is `nativeSetUserId` **[verified: live run]**

`NativeSettingsInterface.nativeSetUserId(String)` is listed in §2.1 as a real
export that nothing in this repository called. It is the engine's own copy of
who is signed in, as distinct from what Cordial's Java side answers when asked.
Called after `nativeAppBridgeV2InitWithParams` and before
`nativeAppBridgeStartLuaAppDM` — the same window §8.2 established for the cookie
natives, and for the same reason — the client reaches:

```text
  [identity] restored a signed-in user from …/identity (username 11 bytes)
  [identity] the engine has been told which user is signed in
[cordial] app start as a signed-in user
[roblox] app ready: PlatformAccountRouter
[roblox] app ready: Startup
[roblox] app ready: Home
[roblox] app ready: RootSwitchNavigator
[roblox] datamodel notification: DID_LOG_IN <identity elided, 161 bytes>
[roblox] datamodel notification: LUA_HOME_PAGE_LOADED
[roblox] datamodel notification: HOME_PAGE_INTERACTIVE
```

So all three are required together: the cookie, the two mirrors, and this. Which
one is load-bearing for which decision was not isolated further — only that the
mirrors alone leave you on `Landing` (§9.3) and the mirrors plus this reach
`Home`.

### 9.5 The bootstrap is two launches, and that is inherent

`DID_LOG_IN` fires when a login happens. A run with a restored cookie and no
identity reaches `Landing` and emits no notification at all — measured, as the
control in §9.6. So the launch that signs in is the launch that captures the
identity, and every launch after it restores one. Exactly the shape of the
cookie store, for the same reason: the engine keeps neither on disk.

It also fires on a *restored* run, about a second after `APP_READY (Home)`,
which is what makes the capture path observable without a second sign-in: the
store is rewritten on every launch that reaches Home, and the file's checksum
changes to prove it.

### 9.6 What is verified, and what is not

**Verified, with a control, on a real signed-in profile:**

| Run | Store | Result |
|---|---|---|
| identity absent | — | `app ready: Landing`, no `DID_LOG_IN` at all |
| identity present, three consecutive runs | restored | `Landing` → `Startup` → **`Home`** → `RootSwitchNavigator`, `DID_LOG_IN` captured and saved on each |
| identity present, `CORDIAL_SKIP_IDENTITY=1`, three consecutive runs | untouched | `app ready: Landing`, `app start as nobody signed in`, store byte-for-byte unchanged |

The control is the same binary and the same profile with one environment
variable different, matching `CORDIAL_SKIP_COOKIES`.

**Verified, on the store itself:** written `0600` by temporary file and rename
through the same writer as the cookie store — still one writer, and since §10
one that is reached only where there is no secret service; a missing, malformed or
future-schema file reads as an ordinary signed-out launch rather than a failure
to start; a zero user id or an empty username is refused rather than persisted,
because zero is exactly what the mirrors said before any of this existed.

**INFERRED, and deliberately not depended on:**

- The logout types (§9.2). Reaching one needs a click.
- `DID_SIGN_UP` and `DID_SWITCH_ACCOUNT` carrying the same payload shape.
- That `getAlternateName` should stay empty when signed in. `DID_LOG_IN` carries
  no alternate name, so echoing the username into it would claim one exists.

**Not established, and the honest reason:**

- **The capture path has never been driven by a human actually signing in under
  this build.** It was demonstrated the other way round: the store was seeded
  once, by hand, from the `DID_LOG_IN` payload in the engine's own FastLog from
  the owner's sign-in — which is byte-for-byte what the capture path would have
  written had it existed at that moment — and every launch since has re-captured
  and rewritten it through the real code path. The remaining gap is the first
  launch of a genuinely new sign-in, which needs someone to type a password.
- Whether `nativeSetUserId` alone would have been enough without the mirrors.
  Not isolated, because the mirrors are needed regardless — `StartAppParams`
  hands the app shell a username it would otherwise render as nobody.
- What the engine does over the network differently now. `DFLogHttpTrace` was
  set in the profile's `flags.json` and produced no `[FLog::Http]` channel in
  the engine's own log, so the 401-versus-200 comparison §5.2 step 5 asks for
  was **not** obtained. What did change is visible instead in the assets: a
  logged-out run asks for `rbxthumb://type=AvatarHeadShot&id=` with an empty
  id, and a restored one fetches a real `tr.rbxcdn.com/…-AvatarHeadshot-…`
  thumbnail.

## 10. Implemented: the session no longer sits on disk in plaintext

§8 and §9 both end by saying, as a verified good property, that the store is
written "`0600` by temporary file and rename". That was accurate and it was not
the question anybody should have been satisfied by. The project owner asked it
in five words — *"fix the plain text cookies; who does that?"* — and they were
right: `<profile>/cookies` held a live `.ROBLOSECURITY`, which is a bearer token
and whole-account access, and `0600` stops another Unix account and nothing
else. A backup, a sync client, a container mount, a second application running
as the same user, or somebody reading over a shoulder all get there.

Both stores prefer the desktop Secret Service in the default `auto` mode,
with file fallback when it is unavailable. Explicit `file` skips the keyring;
explicit `keyring` refuses file fallback. Nothing above about the
*format* changes: the same body that used to be the file's contents is the
item's value, which is what makes the migration a move rather than a
re-derivation.

### 10.1 The argument that had kept it on disk, and why it failed

Recorded here as well as in ADR-012 because this document is where it was
relied on. The objection was mine, in two halves.

*A keyring adds an unlock prompt to every launch.* False on this platform.
**[verified: live bus]** `org.freedesktop.secrets` answers
`org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer.Ping`; `Service.Collections` lists `login` and
`session`; both report `Locked = false` with nothing typed, because the login
keyring is unlocked by the session's own login. Sober links `libsecret-1.so.0`
and exposes `use_libsecret`, which settles that this is ordinary.

*It protects against nothing extra, because the token is handed to the engine in
plaintext regardless.* The premise is true and the conclusion does not follow.
In-process plaintext for the life of a run is not on-disk plaintext for ever,
and every threat in the list above is a read of the file by something acting as
the user — which is precisely what `0600` permits.

### 10.2 What it talks to, and what it refuses to do **[verified: cordial]**

`org.freedesktop.secrets` is the interface; `gnome-keyring-daemon` implements it
on GNOME, KWallet and KeePassXC elsewhere, and libsecret is one client for it.
`crates/cordial-shell/src/secrets.rs` and its submodules speak the interface over
`zbus`. The runtime reexports this shared backend through its existing `secrets`
module, so account routing and the running client use the same storage format.

An item is keyed by four attributes — `xdg:schema=org.cordial.Session`,
`application=cordial`, `store=cookies|identity`, and `profile=<absolute profile
path>`. The path rather than the profile *name*, because every agent and test in
this repository runs under its own `XDG_DATA_HOME` and every one of those roots
has a profile called `default`.

The hard constraint is the owner's, and it governs the whole module: **a stored
session is a convenience and never a prerequisite** — a locked keyring must not
prevent a launch. So the collection's `Locked` property
is read and `Unlock` is **never** called; every call is bounded by a timeout on
a thread of its own, because `zbus`'s blocking API has none and a save runs on
the looper thread. A missing or locked service selects announced file fallback
in `auto` mode, or no saved session in explicit `keyring` mode. An unreadable
stored session leaves the client on the landing page rather than failing launch.

### 10.3 Measured, 2026-08-02, on a scratch profile with a fabricated token

Four machines' worth of answers, driven through `cookies::load` rather than
through the module's internals. `records` is what the launch would restore.

| Machine | Store | Result |
|---|---|---|
| service present, default setting | `Keyring` | 146 bytes adopted, `records=1`, plaintext file gone |
| `CORDIAL_SECRET_STORE=file` | `File` | `records=1`, file present, and the line says plaintext |
| no session bus, default setting | `File` | `records=1`, warned, named the file, named the way to refuse it |
| no session bus, `CORDIAL_SECRET_STORE=keyring` | `None` | `records=0`, nothing saved, the plaintext file named and ignored rather than used or deleted |

The item's presence was confirmed with `secret-tool search application cordial`
filtered to its attributes, and its size separately as a byte count. **No test,
run or log in this work handled a real session**, and nothing anywhere prints a
value.

**[inferred]** That a *locked but present* collection takes the same path as an
absent one. Both collections on the machine this was written on are unlocked,
and locking one to find out would have locked the owner's real keyring. What is
measured is that the `Locked` read returns without a prompt, and that every
downstream consequence of it saying "locked" degrades rather than fails.
