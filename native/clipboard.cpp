// Copy out of Roblox, and the message the engine sends to ask for it.
//
// **The engine does not ask for `android.content.ClipboardManager`.**
// `docs/analysis/framework-classes.txt` lists `ClipboardManager`, `ClipData`,
// `ClipData$Item` and `ClipDescription`, and that is what made this look like a
// framework class to implement. It is not one, for the same reason
// `docs/analysis/webview-surface.md` §1 gives about `WebView`: that file is the
// dex's referenced-type table, so it says Roblox's *Java* code uses those
// classes, not that `libroblox.so` reaches for them. Cordial does not run
// Roblox's Java code — it stands in for it.
//
// What the engine actually does was read out of the shipping build rather than
// guessed:
//
//   * `readelf --dyn-syms` over `libroblox.so` exports no clipboard native at
//     all. Nothing matching `clip` or `paste`, out of 508 `Java_*` exports.
//   * The engine's string pool holds exactly one clipboard-shaped string,
//     `setClipboardText`, alongside `ExternalContentSharing`, `shareText`,
//     `shareUrl`, `shareImage` and `shareVideo`.
//   * `tools/dex_method.py` finds no method called `setClipboardText` anywhere
//     in the three dex files, but the dex *string* table holds
//     `ExternalContentSharing.setClipboardText` next to `ClipboardManager`,
//     `newPlainText`, `setPrimaryClip` and the error text
//     "setClipboardText received null content value for clipboard."
//
// A name that exists as a string on both sides and as a method on neither is a
// message-bus message id. So this is the same shape as the cookie jar and the
// deep link: the engine publishes, Roblox's Java subscribes, and Cordial has to
// be the subscriber. `native/cookies.cpp` and `native/deeplink.cpp` set out the
// same reasoning for their own surfaces.
//
// The four `share*` methods each have a native that hands out their message id
// (`JNIExternalContentSharingProtocol.getShareTextId` and friends).
// `setClipboardText` has no such getter, which is why the id is spelled out
// here rather than asked for.
//
// The other direction — pasting *into* Roblox — has no engine-side ask at all,
// and that is not an omission here. On Android a focused TextBox is edited by a
// real `android.widget.EditText` laid over the GL surface (see
// `CordialTextBoxInfo` in `android_classes.cpp`), so Android's own editor
// handles the paste and the engine only ever sees the resulting text arrive
// through `gametextinput`. Cordial's equivalent of that editor is
// `android::input`, so the paste path is `android::clipboard::paste_into_engine`
// and involves no JNI at all.
//
// **Nothing in this file prints a clipboard value.** The payload is a JSON
// document that came from whatever the user copied inside an experience; it is
// counted and handed on, never logged. The trace switch reports the message id
// and a byte count. `crates/cordial-runtime/src/android/clipboard.rs` carries
// the rest of that rule, and is the only place the text is looked at.
//
// This file also carries the message-bus *subscribe* machinery, and that part
// is no longer clipboard-specific. It used to be: one `g_payload_sink`, one
// `g_connection`, one `g_connection_ptr`, all module-level globals, because
// clipboard was the only subscriber anybody had written. `docs/analysis/
// webview-surface.md`'s "What is left, precisely" names the bug that shape
// was about to cause: the web window needs its own subscription to
// `openWindow`, and a second subscriber going through those same three
// globals would not add a subscription, it would silently overwrite
// clipboard's, exactly the way registering a class twice under this same
// engine already did once. `cordial_messagebus_subscribe` below is keyed by
// message id — a callback and a `Connection` per id, in a map, so clipboard's
// subscription and any other module's live independently. Nothing about
// clipboard's own behaviour changes; it is now one caller of a shared
// mechanism rather than the owner of it.
