//! `Linking.openURL` — the engine asking the host to open a link.
//!
//! Clicking Terms, Privacy, or an experience's external link did nothing in
//! Cordial while Sober opened a browser. Not a bug: nothing was ever bound to
//! answer the request.
//!
//! **It is not an `Intent`.** Roblox's own Java builds the `ACTION_VIEW`
//! intent on Android, and Roblox's Java is exactly the layer Cordial replaces,
//! so no `android/content/Intent` appears anywhere in this path -- consistent
//! with `docs/analysis/deep-links.md`, which found every `Intent` line in the
//! Android capture belonging to Google Play services rather than to Roblox's
//! own pid. What the engine actually does is bind a message-bus *request*:
//! protocol `Linking`, method `openURL`, payload `{"url": "..."}`, and it
//! waits for `{"success": <bool>}` back.
//!
//! The vocabulary is not guessed. `libroblox.so` exports zero-argument getters
//! for every piece of it -- `getProtocolName`, `getOpenURLId`, `getUrlKey`,
//! `getSuccessKey` -- and their values were read out of a running engine and
//! recorded in `docs/analysis/deep-links.md`: `"Linking"`, `"openURL"`,
//! `"url"`. The live ClientSettings for this build corroborate the shape by
//! name, `FFlagKeepLinkingOpenUrlRequestHandlerBound` among them.
//!
//! This is the request/response half of the bus, which is why it needs
//! `setRequestHandlerRaw` rather than the `doSubscribeRaw` the inbound
//! direction uses. `deeplink.cpp` handles links coming *in*; this is the way
//! out.
