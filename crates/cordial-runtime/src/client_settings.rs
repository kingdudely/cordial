//! Roblox's client settings — the FastFlag set the engine runs on.
//!
//! On Android the *application* fetches this document and hands it to the engine
//! through `NativeGLInterface.nativeInitClientSettings`. Cordial is the host
//! application here, so doing that fetch is the job, not a workaround.
//!
//! **"The engine never fetches it itself" was the rest of this paragraph, and it
//! is wrong.** It rested on breakpoints on `getaddrinfo`, `connect` and
//! `SSL_connect` never being hit during startup, which is a statement about the
//! first second and was read as a statement about the process. The engine runs a
//! `DynamicFastVariableReloader` of its own. Turning the engine's own HTTP
//! tracing on (`DFLogHttpTraceLight`) shows it, on 2.734.0.917, signed in:
//!
//! ```text
//! 2.251  HttpResponse(#22) status:200 bodySize:1305506
//!        url:{ "https://clientsettingscdn.roblox.com/v2/settings-compressed/application/GoogleAndroidApp.zst" }
//! 4.150  [FlagCache] writeFlagCache: Successfully wrote 372673 bytes
//! 120.11 [FLog::DynamicFastVariableReloader] DynamicFastVariableReloader finished flag fetch
//! ```
//!
//! Note the application name: the engine asks for **`GoogleAndroidApp`**, and
//! since 2026-09-24 this file does too by default ([`ENGINE_URL`],
//! `CORDIAL_ENGINE_SETTINGS=0` reverts to the `AndroidApp` document it fetched
//! before that). They are not the same document -- `docs/analysis/flag-init.md`
//! SS23.4 counted 441 differing values -- and a live rollout made the
//! difference between a blank screen and a working Landing page, 20/20 launches
//! each way; see [`ENGINE_URL`]'s doc comment for the measurement.
//!
//! What that reloader costs is written up on [`apply_overrides`], because it is
//! the thing that decides how long an override survives.
//!
//! ## The call contract, established by experiment
//!
//! `nativeInitClientSettings(String, String, String)` returns an `int`. Feeding
//! it known-good and known-bad documents settles what it means:
//!
//! (An earlier version of this note called that return value "the only
//! trustworthy signal, since the engine's own `FLog` output is not routed
//! anywhere visible in this build". The second half was wrong. `FLog` is routed,
//! and always has been — the engine writes it to `appData/logs/*.log`, relative
//! to the working directory. Read that file; it is the best diagnostic Cordial
//! has.)
//!
//! | first argument | result |
//! |---|---|
//! | the real document, `{"applicationSettings": {...}}` | `0` |
//! | `{"applicationSettings":{"FFlagNotARealFlag":"True"}}` | `0` |
//! | `this is not json at all` | `1` |
//! | `{}` — valid JSON, no `applicationSettings` key | `1` |
//!
//! So **`0` is success**, the document goes in the *first* argument, and the
//! `applicationSettings` wrapper must be kept rather than unwrapped. Passing the
//! document in either of the other two positions returns `1` regardless of
//! whether it is valid, which is what "this argument is not the settings" looks
//! like. One of those two is an overrides document — the engine has a
//! `ParseFailure on overrides` log string — but which is still unestablished, so
//! both are left empty rather than guessed at.
//!
//! Those first readings were confounded: `--client-settings` fed *two* call
//! sites, so `nativeInitializeNativeFlags` was receiving the document too and
//! the result could not be attributed to this call alone. On the automatic path
//! the flag-names call gets nothing, and the discriminator survives cleanly —
//! empty string gives `1`, the real document gives `0`. The conclusion held, but
//! it had not actually been shown until the two were separated.
