//! Which graphics backend the engine is given, and who asked for it.
//!
//! ## This is not a FastFlag, and the measurement that says so
//!
//! There is an obvious-looking way to do this and it does not work.
//! `FStringDebugGraphicsPreferredBackend` is a real Roblox flag, the shell used
//! to expose it as the Renderer row, and `flags_file.rs` described `"Vulkan"` as
//! "the only value confirmed anywhere in this repository". **It changes
//! nothing.** Measured 2026-08-03 on 2.730.0.790, one launch each, reading the
//! engine's own `Loaded N shaders from pack <name>` line:
//!
//! ```text
//! (no flag)                     -> pack vulkan_mobile
//! "CordialProbeNotABackend"     -> pack vulkan_mobile
//! "OpenGL" "GLES" "GLES3"       -> pack vulkan_mobile
//! "OpenGLES" "glsles3"          -> pack vulkan_mobile
//! ```
//!
//! Deliberate rubbish is accepted in silence, which is the important half: a
//! wrong value is indistinguishable from no value, so a settings row built on
//! this flag would have looked like it worked and done nothing. That was the
//! exact risk `flags_file.rs` named when it refused to guess a GLES spelling,
//! and it was right — but its own "confirmed" value is confirmed only as a
//! string that appears in our README. `"Vulkan"` produces output identical to
//! setting nothing, because Vulkan is what the engine takes anyway.
//!
//! ## What does work
//!
//! `libroblox.so` links no Vulkan at all — it is not in `DT_NEEDED`, and the
//! engine `dlopen`s `libvulkan.so` and then `libvulkan.so.1` (see
//! [`crate::android::vulkan`]). So the backend is chosen by whether that
//! `dlopen` finds anything, and Cordial is what answers it. Withhold the
//! virtual soname and the engine takes its own documented fall-through to
//! GLES3. Measured, same day, with the Vulkan ICD made unavailable:
//!
//! ```text
//! [FLog::Graphics] Trying to choose EGL config r8 g8 b8 vsync0
//! [FLog::Graphics] Initialized EGL context ... with renderbuffer 1280x720
//! Loaded ... from pack glsles3 variant default
//! Compiled 618 shaders in 75 ms
//! -> onDataModelNotification: Received type(APP_READY, 10), data(Landing)
//! ```
//!
//! The APK ships exactly two shader packs — `shaders_vulkan_mobile.pack` and
//! `shaders_glsles3.pack` — so that log line names the backend unambiguously
//! and is the way to check any claim made here.
//!
//! That run forced it the blunt way, by making the Vulkan ICD unavailable to
//! the whole process. **Withholding the virtual soname was then shown to be
//! equivalent**, through this module rather than around it:
//!
//! ```text
//! CORDIAL_GRAPHICS=gles     -> from pack glsles3
//! CORDIAL_GRAPHICS=vulkan   -> from pack vulkan_mobile
//! (unset)                   -> from pack vulkan_mobile
//! CordialGraphicsBackend=gles in a flag layer, no env -> from pack glsles3
//! ```
//!
//! The last two are the control: the same binary, the same profile, the switch
//! being the only difference.
//!
//! **Still not established:** that GLES3 is *stable*. One launch to Landing is
//! not a stability result, this project has a bug that reproduced on roughly one
//! launch in three, and nothing here has been signed in or run inside an
//! experience. The setting is offered because withholding Vulkan demonstrably
//! selects the backend, not because the backend is known to be good.
//!
//! ## Precedence, which is the user's and then the plugins'
//!
//! The same rule [`crate::flags`] already applies to everything else: an
//! explicit setting is the one thing that must not be quietly overridden, and a
//! plugin gets its say only where the user has not had one. `Automatic` is not
//! a third opinion competing with those two — it is the absence of a user
//! opinion, which is exactly what leaves the door open for a plugin.
//!
//! A plugin asks by writing [`KEY`] into its own flag layer. That key is
//! Cordial's rather than Roblox's, so it never reaches the engine's settings —
//! see `client_settings.rs`, which drops the `Cordial` prefix before applying.
