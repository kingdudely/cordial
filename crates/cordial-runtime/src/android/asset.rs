//! `AAssetManager` — Roblox's assets, read out of the APK.
//!
//! This is the gate on rendering: the engine loads every shader, font and
//! texture through it, so nothing appears on screen until it works.
//!
//! Roblox uses the whole-buffer half of the API (`AAsset_getBuffer` and
//! `AAsset_getLength`) rather than streaming `AAsset_read`, which makes the
//! implementation much simpler than the general case — an asset is just its
//! decompressed bytes, held until closed.
//!
//! Android serves assets from `assets/` inside the APK. That is a plain zip, and
//! the paths Roblox passes are relative to it.
//!
//! Before the zip is ever consulted, every lookup is checked against the
//! overlay stack — see the `overlay` section below. That is
//! [ADR-010](../../../../docs/adr/ADR-010-plugin-asset-overlays.md): plugins
//! and the user may provide files that resolve in place of the APK's own,
//! without Cordial ever writing into the APK or into anything extracted from
//! it.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- the overlay

// ADR-010 decided that a plugin, or the user directly, may provide a file that
// resolves in place of the APK's own for the same name.
// [ADR-021](../../../../docs/adr/ADR-021-everything-is-a-plugin.md) settles how,
// and extends it to the second route the engine uses. The whole mechanism is a
// lookup interposed ahead of the zip read above — nothing is ever copied into
// the APK, nothing is ever copied into `extract_to`'s output, and removing a
// root is exactly as simple as no longer consulting it. There is no cleanup
// step because there was never a write to undo.
//
// **Why interception rather than a mount.** The assets are zip entries inside
// `base.apk`, so overlayfs has nothing to overlay without extracting the whole
// archive first, and Flatpak cannot mount overlayfs unprivileged in any case.
// Interception also yields the request trace, the two orphan signals and the
// shadow report below, none of which a mount can provide.
//
// **Why an open-intercept is not defeated by mmap.** The hazard in general is
// a client that maps the archive once and reads each asset at an offset inside
// that mapping, so no asset ever gets an fd. Sampled every 400 ms across two
// complete cold launches — 136 samples, `libroblox.so` mapped in every one —
// `/proc/<pid>/maps` and `/proc/<pid>/fd` held zero references to `base.apk`
// and zero to the extracted asset tree. There was never a whole-archive
// mapping to find. ADR-021 records the reading.
//
// One thing this does *not* attempt: if an asset is already cached (served
// once, from either the overlay or the APK), it stays cached for the rest of
// the process — the same "cached forever" contract `Manager::read` already
// gives the APK path, because Roblox is handed a pointer that has to remain
// valid. Reloading the overlay after an asset has already been served does not
// retroactively change what a held pointer points at, and `reload` reports how
// many names it could not affect for exactly that reason.

// handed `setAssetFolder <cache>/assets/content` and reads through libc, which
// is the route ADR-010 explicitly left out of scope and ADR-021 brings in.
//
// The two routes share this one resolver and one index. They must, or an
// overlay applies to a texture reached one way and not to the same texture
// reached the other, which is a bug nobody would guess from the symptom.
//
// Ground truth on what has to be covered, from the engine's own dynamic symbol
// table rather than from reasoning about it: `libroblox.so` imports `access`,
// `fdopen`, `fopen`, `fstat`, `ftruncate`, `lstat`, `mmap`, `open`, `opendir`,
// `readlink`, `realpath` and `stat`. **There is no `openat`**, no `fstatat`,
// no `statx` and no `open64`, so the classic dirfd-relative bypass has nothing
// to bypass through on this build — a fact to re-check whenever the build
// moves, which `docs/analysis/undefined-symbols.tsv` makes a one-line diff.
//
// `fstat` needs no resolver and that is a result rather than an omission: it
// takes an fd, which is the fd our `open` already returned, pointing at the
// overlay file itself, so it reports the overlay's size because it is looking
// at the overlay. The size-versus-bytes mismatch everyone warns about needs
// the two to come from different files, and it can only arise through the
// *path-taking* size and existence calls — `stat`, `lstat` and `access` —
// every one of which is already in `native/system_paths.cpp`'s table beside
// `open`. Hence the invariant that table enforces: every path-taking function
// in it consults this resolver, or none of them do.

/// a real directory and gives the engine that directory.
///
/// Cordial was passing the `.apk` file itself as `assetFolderPath`, so every

/// inside a file and could not be opened. TLS verification then has no roots,
/// which fails the client-settings fetch, which fails the flag set — three
/// layers away from anything that mentions certificates.
///
/// Extraction is skipped when the destination is **stamped with this exact
/// APK**, so repeat launches pay for it once and a new Roblox build pays for
/// it again.
///
/// **Two defects fixed here on 2026-08-22, both of the kind this project calls
/// its most expensive.**
///
/// *It had no staleness check at all.* The test was `out.exists()`, per file,
/// so a new APK left every previously-extracted asset exactly as it was and
/// the engine ran the new build against the old build's content. That is the
/// same silent version mismatch `cordial_update::cache`'s own module doc was
/// written for, one directory across — the shell had it fixed for
/// `libroblox.so` and this had not. The fix is that module, not a second
/// notion of "is this current": two independent answers to that question is
/// how one of them quietly stops being true, and `install.rs` already has the
/// tests pinning both directions.
///
/// *It had no completion marker.* An extraction interrupted half way left a
/// partial tree that the per-file existence check then read as finished, and
/// nothing anywhere would ever have said so. The stamp is now the completion
/// marker: it is written after the last file and nowhere else, so a partial
/// tree is unstamped, and unstamped is not current.
///
/// Each file is also written through a temporary and renamed into place, so no
/// individual asset can be observed half-written — the engine `mmap`s some of
/// these and a truncated read is a texture rendered as garbage rather than an
/// error anybody sees.
///
/// **The tree is overwritten in place rather than swapped in.** Same choice
/// `install.rs` makes and for the same reason it records: deleting first would
/// leave a user with nothing at all if the extraction then failed, and an
/// unstamped tree simply re-extracts next launch, which is slow rather than
/// wrong.
///
/// **A gap that remains, named rather than left to be discovered.** A file
/// present in the old APK and absent from the new one is not removed, because
/// nothing here walks the destination to diff it. The filesystem route would
/// still serve that orphan. It has not been seen and removing a cache
/// directory's contents is a change that wants its own test rather than a
