//! The session, kept across a restart, because the engine will not keep it.
//!
//! **The bug.** Sign in, quit, restart against the same profile, and you are on
//! the landing page again. Reported twice, and reproduced on a single profile,
//! so it is not the `flock` in [`crate::profile`] handing out a different
//! directory on the second launch.
//!
//! **What was actually measured**, because the diagnosis is not the obvious one
//! and the obvious one wastes a day. A complete `CORDIAL_TRACE_PATHS=1`
//! inventory of every non-system file the engine opens contains no cookie jar
//! and no credential store, and `grep -rl ROBLOSECURITY` over a real profile
//! tree finds nothing. The engine holds its cookies in memory for the life of
//! the process. On Android the *Java* side persists them — the Waydroid capture
//! has `OnSetCookieHandlerImpl.b(): Updated WebViewCookieHandler with Cookies
//! from URL ...` and eight other cookie lines — and Cordial has no Java side.
//!
//! That rules out the fix everyone reaches for first. A shutdown hook cannot
//! flush a file that is never written. The graceful teardown descent in
//! `android::looper` exists and works, and alternating killed and graceful runs
//! over two passes produced no file created or updated at shutdown that a
//! killed run does not also produce. Teardown was never the missing piece; the
//! Java side was.
//!
//! So Cordial becomes the Java side, and with it the custodian of a session
//! token — which reverses a decision written down in
//! [ADR-012](../../../docs/adr/ADR-012-profiles-and-instances.md) and in
//! `profile.rs`, both of which said Cordial "never reads or handles" one. That
//! reasoning rested on the engine reading its cookie from a file, which the
//! measurement above disproves. The ADR records the reversal rather than
//! quietly contradicting it.
//!
//! **The cookie is necessary and is not sufficient**, which cost a second round
//! of this. With the store restored and the engine confirmed holding five
//! cookies for each of four domains, the client still reached `app ready:
//! Landing`, because `PlatformAccountRouter` asks who is signed in rather than
//! what cookies are held. [`crate::identity`] is the other half, and neither
//! half alone signs anybody in.
//!
//! **Where it goes: the desktop secret service, and the paragraph that used to
//! stand here was wrong.** It said a keyring "adds an unlock prompt to every
//! launch and protects against nothing extra here, because the token has to be
//! handed to the engine in plaintext on every start regardless". The second
//! half is true and does not lead where it was taken: a token in the clear
//! inside a running process is not a token in the clear on disk for ever, and
//! it is the disk copy a backup, a sync client or a second application running
//! as the same user actually reaches. The first half was false on this
//! platform — `org.freedesktop.secrets` answers, and its default collection is
//! unlocked by the session login without anything being typed.
//!
//! So the store is [`crate::secrets`], which puts both this and
//! [`crate::identity`] into `org.freedesktop.secrets` keyed by profile path,
//! falls back to the old `0600` file with a warning where there is no service,
//! and never blocks a launch or raises a prompt to do it. ADR-012 records the
//! reversal and names the mistaken objection as mine.
//!
//! **Two things about the engine's contract that were measured here and are
//! not what the design document assumed**, both of which produced a working
//! call and a silently empty jar before they were found:
//!
//! The cookie natives do nothing until the app bridge exists. Called before
//! `nativeAppBridgeSetInitParams`, where `docs/design/sign-in.md` §5.2 said to
//! put them, `nativeSetMultipleCookies` returns cleanly and stores nothing.
//! `CORDIAL_COOKIE_PROBE=1` sets a marker and reads it straight back at four
//! points in the startup sequence: 0 bytes at startup, 0 after init params, 51
//! from `nativeAppBridgeV2InitWithParams` onwards.
//!
//! The getter and the setter do not speak the same language.
//! `nativeGetCookiesForDomain` returns Netscape `cookies.txt` records joined by
//! `"; "`; `nativeSetMultipleCookies` wants `name=value` pairs. Handing the
//! getter's output straight back writes 51 bytes and leaves the engine holding
//! zero. [`to_settable`] is the conversion, and the store holds the converted
//! form so a restore is a straight hand-over.
//!
//! **Nothing in this module logs a cookie value.** The type carrying one is
//! [`Jar`], whose `Debug` prints a length; getting at the bytes takes a
//! deliberate `expose()`, and the places that do it are the write to disk, the
//! hand-off to the engine, and the separator counting in [`shape`]. Every
//! diagnostic here reports a count or a size.
