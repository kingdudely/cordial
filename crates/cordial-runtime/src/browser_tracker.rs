//! The device's tracker identity — `RBXEventTrackerV2`.
//!
//! Roblox's clients identify the *device* separately from the account, through a
//! cookie called `RBXEventTrackerV2` obtained from
//! `apis.roblox.com/browser-tracker-api/device/initialize`. Cordial has never
//! asked for one, and has therefore always run without a device identity.
//!
//! ## Why this is here now
//!
//! Not from reading the binary. mocktail — which plays for four minutes on the
//! place Cordial is disconnected from at sixty seconds — bootstraps this before
//! its engine starts, and Cordial does not. §13 of `docs/analysis/flag-init.md`
//! has the measurement.
//!
//! Two things in this repository already pointed at it and were never joined up:
//! `docs/analysis/webview-surface.md` records that `libroblox.so` carries the
//! string `BrowserTrackerIdRequest: No RBXEventTrackerV2 in cookie.`, so the
//! engine has a path that notices the cookie missing; and `docs/design/sign-in.md`
//! captured this exact endpoint being called on real Android.
//!
//! **It is `INFERRED` that this has anything to do with the 304.** What is
//! established is that a working client does it and Cordial does not. That is a
//! reason to try it with a control, not a diagnosis.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! This is an ordinary HTTPS request that the real client makes, answered by
//! Roblox's own server, and the value kept is the one Roblox returns. Nothing is
//! forged, replayed, or asserted on the client's behalf — the suggestion in the
//! query string is exactly that, and the server is free to ignore it and hand
//! back something else. That is the same footing as fetching client settings in
//! [`crate::client_settings`], which is also work the host application is
//! supposed to do.
