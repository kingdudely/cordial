//! bionic's pthread surface, answered here rather than by a host library or a
//! stub.
//!
//! Two opposite reasons to be in this file. A type whose layout differs between
//! the libcs is *wrapped*: the bionic-sized object becomes a handle and the real
//! glibc object lives on the heap behind it. A type that is laid out the same is
//! *forwarded* straight to the host — those entry points are here only because
//! the alternative was a generated stub, and for `pthread_once` and
//! thread-specific data a stub is fatal.
//!
//! Sizes in bytes, measured rather than read off. One probe translation unit
//! declaring `char sz_x[sizeof(x)];` per type, compiled once per libc and the
//! symbol sizes read back with `nm -S`. The bionic columns are against this
//! tree's `third_party/mcpelauncher-linker/bionic/libc/include` at
//! `-D__ANDROID_API__=33` and the architecture's own `-target *-linux-android`
//! triple; the glibc columns are against that architecture's own real glibc
//! (2.43, both times this was written). The x86_64 pair was the original
//! measurement; the aarch64 pair was added on 2026-09-23, compiled x86_64
//! natively and aarch64 inside a Fedora 44 container under qemu emulation,
//! since this host has no aarch64 glibc-devel of its own — cross-checked
//! against `grep __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEX_T /usr/include/bits/pthreadtypes-arch.h`
//! inside that container, which agrees with the `nm` reading exactly.

//!
//! `sem_t` is a real mismatch on both architectures: glibc's `sem_init` writes
//! 32 bytes into a 16-byte object, so the 16 bytes after it belong to whatever
//! was adjacent. The wrapper is what stops that.
//!
//! **bionic's own sizes are identical across architectures**, and that is not
//! a coincidence worth reading much into: every one of these types is declared
//! in terms of `__LP64__` in
//! `third_party/mcpelauncher-linker/bionic/libc/include/bits/pthread_types.h`,
//! not the specific processor, and both `x86_64-android` and `aarch64-android`
//! are LP64. What varies by architecture is glibc, and on x86_64 it happened
//! to agree with bionic for `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_attr_t` — which is
//! exactly what made the x86_64-only measurement look more reassuring than it
//! was; nothing here had ever checked whether that agreement was structural or
//! a coincidence of one architecture's glibc.
//!
//! **It was a coincidence. `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_attr_t` were a real
//! size mismatch on aarch64, and this was found before either was wrapped.**
//! glibc's aarch64 `pthread_mutex_t` is 48 bytes against bionic's 40; its
//! `pthread_attr_t` is 64 against bionic's 56. Roblox's engine allocates
//! these objects at bionic's size, because that is the only size it knows,
//! so handing either straight to glibc's `pthread_mutex_init` /
//! `pthread_mutex_lock` / … or `pthread_attr_init` / … meant the host libc
//! read and wrote past the end of an object the engine allocated smaller —
//! the same class of overrun `sem_t` already needed a wrapper for, just one
//! that happened not to bite on x86_64. `pthread_mutex_t` is the engine's
//! most heavily used pthread primitive, so this was never a corner case; it
//! was whichever mutex got locked first.
//!
//! **Both are wrapped now**, `BionicMutex`/`BionicAttr` further down this
//! file, aarch64 only — on x86_64 neither type is in [`overrides`] at all,
//! and `pthread_mutex_*`/`pthread_attr_*` keep resolving straight from the
//! host exactly as before this paragraph existed. The mutex wrapper has to
//! handle a mutex that was never explicitly initialised: bionic spells
//! `PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER`, `_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP` and
//! `_ERRORCHECK_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP` as three different raw words in the
//! object's own memory, and each has to keep behaving as its declared type
//! on the very first lock, having never passed through `pthread_mutex_init`
//! — see `resolve_mutex`'s own comment for how that differs from
//! `pthread_cond_t`'s and `sem_t`'s single-sentinel lazy init below. The attr
//! wrapper also has to follow `attr` through to `pthread_create` (there is
//! no POSIX static initialiser for an attr, so it has no equivalent
//! complication) — `native/thread_trace.cpp`'s `cordial_pthread_create` calls
//! back into this file, on aarch64 only, to resolve `attr` before forwarding
//! it to the host's own `pthread_create`.
//!
//! **Run, not just typechecked, as of 2026-09-23**: `cargo test --release -p
//! cordial-runtime --lib bionic::pthread::` inside the same emulated aarch64
//! container the size measurement used, natively (the container is aarch64;
//! nothing here is cross-compiled) -- 14 passed, 0 failed, covering a
//! statically-initialised normal/recursive/errorcheck mutex each, a mutex
//! locked and unlocked by eight threads at once, an attr's stack size read
//! back through its own getter, and the same value read back on the far side
//! of a real `pthread_create`/`pthread_getattr_np` round trip through
//! `native/thread_trace.cpp`. **Still not run**: against real ARM64
//! hardware, or against Roblox's own engine -- an emulated qemu-user
//! container proves the ABI translation is right, not that the engine's
//! actual lock usage pattern is.
//!
//! **The `pthread_cond_t` row used to read 32 against 48, and it was wrong.**
//! 32 bytes is `pthread_barrier_t`, which is `int64_t __private[4]`;
//! `pthread_cond_t` is `int32_t __private[12]`, a few declarations further down
//! the same header, and comes to 48 on LP64 — the same as glibc's. The commit
//! that introduced this module recorded the overrun as one of three ABI
//! divergences found, and the measurement above says there was no overrun to
//! find. The wrapper stays for now: it is harmless either way, since it only
//! ever writes the first 12 bytes of the caller's object, and taking it out
//! changes what runs at every `pthread_cond_wait` in the engine — a behaviour
//! change that wants its own measurement rather than a free ride on this one.
//!
//! Initialisation of a wrapper is lazy because bionic's
//! `PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER` is all zeroes, so a statically-initialised
//! condition variable can reach `wait` without `init` ever being called.

/// `[stub] pthread_getspecific` as the last two lines before the core dump.
///
/// Compiling bionic's own implementations instead is right for exactly one of
/// the five, which is why none of them does it. `pthread_key.cpp` reaches
/// thread-specific data through `__get_bionic_tls()`, which is
/// `__get_tls()[TLS_SLOT_BIONIC_TLS]` — a pointer to bionic's own thread
/// structure, hanging off the thread pointer of a thread bionic created. Every
/// thread in this process belongs to the host's libc, so that slot holds
/// whatever glibc keeps at that offset and the load reads the wrong memory.
/// That is worse than the stub it replaced, because it would appear to work.
/// `pthread_once.cpp` is the exception — a compare-exchange loop on the
/// caller's own `int` plus a futex, touching no thread structure at all — so it
/// could be ported standalone. Forwarding costs less and behaves the same.
///
/// Forwarding is safe *here* for a reason that does not generalise, and reading
/// it as a general licence is how `struct stat` and `sigset_t` would get passed
/// through next. It is safe only where the argument is laid out identically in
/// both libcs. `pthread_once_t` is `int` in both, 4 bytes against 4, and both
/// spell `PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT` as 0 — so a bionic once-control that was
/// statically initialised and never passed to bionic's implementation already
/// *is* a valid glibc one. `pthread_key_t` is 4 bytes in both and is opaque to
/// the caller. Compare `sem_t` at the top of this file, 16 against 32, where
/// the same forwarding would write past the end of the object.
///
/// One difference forwarding does not hide, and it is **INFERRED** — nothing
/// has been observed depending on it. bionic sets `KEY_VALID_FLAG`, bit 31, in
/// every key it hands out, so a bionic key is always a negative `int`; glibc's
/// are small non-negative ones and the first is 0. Code that treats key 0 as
