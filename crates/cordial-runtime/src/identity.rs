//! Who is signed in, kept across a restart, because the cookie is not enough.
//!
//! **The bug this finishes.** [`crate::cookies`] made the session survive a
//! restart and the user was still on the landing page. That was measured, not
//! assumed: with a real signed-in store restored, the engine reports five
//! cookies held for each of four domains and the run still ends
//! `[roblox] app ready: Landing`.
//!
//! **Why.** Roblox asks Cordial who is signed in, through two Java mirrors that
//! were hardcoded to nobody — `NativeUserJavaInterface.getUserId` returning 0
//! with an empty `getUsername`, and `StartAppParams`' `appUserId`/`username`/
//! `isUnder13`/`membershipType` all zeroed. `PlatformAccountRouter` runs after
//! the cookie restore, asks the mirrors, is told user 0 with an empty name, and
//! routes to the landing page. It never gets as far as the network, which is
//! why the cookie being correct changed nothing.
//!
//! `docs/design/sign-in.md` §1.3 said these mirrors were presentation-layer
//! only and made redundant by the cookie. **That was wrong**, and §9 of that
//! document now says so; this module is the correction in code.
//!
//! **Where the identity comes from — the engine hands it over.** Its own
//! DataModel notification carries exactly the fields the mirrors want. From the
//! owner's own sign-in, in the engine's FastLog, values elided here as they are
//! everywhere else in this module:
//!
//! ```text
//! onDataModelNotification: Received type(DID_LOG_IN, 28), data({"username":…,
//!   "membershipType":0,"isUnder13":false,"hasRobloxSubscription":false,
//!   "countryCode":…,"userId":…,"displayName":…})
//! onDataModelNotification: Received type(APP_READY, 10), data(Home)
//! ```
//!
//! Cordial received that on `NativeGLJavaInterface.onDataModelNotificationCallback`,
//! printed it — username and user id and all — and dropped it. So this module
//! catches it, and `native/android_classes.cpp` stopped printing it.
//!
//! **The bootstrap is two launches, and that is inherent rather than a defect.**
//! `DID_LOG_IN` fires when a login happens, not when a session is restored: a
//! run with a restored cookie and no identity reaches `Landing` and emits no
//! notification at all, measured. So the launch that signs in is the launch that
//! captures the identity, and every launch after it restores one. Same shape as
//! the cookie, and for the same reason — the engine keeps neither on disk.
//!
//! **Privacy.** A username and a user id identify a real person, so nothing here
//! prints either at any verbosity. [`Identity`]'s `Debug` reports lengths;
//! reaching a value takes a named accessor, and the only callers are the write
//! to the store and the hand-off to the mirrors. The store itself is
//! [`crate::secrets`], the same one the cookie goes into: an item in
//! `org.freedesktop.secrets` keyed by profile path, falling back to the old
//! `0600` file with a warning where there is no secret service. It used to be
//! that file unconditionally, and ADR-012 records why that was wrong and whose
//! argument made it so.
