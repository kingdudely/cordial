//! Deciding what changed in a profile's plugin set, so a running client can
//! start, stop or restart exactly the plugins that moved rather than the
//! whole set -- and never anything more than the diff says.
//!
//! **What this does not do.** It does not touch a process, a broker or a
//! thread. Everything below is pure: read the disk, compare two snapshots,
//! say what changed. `cordial-runtime`'s `plugin_host` is what acts on the
//! answer -- spawning through the same `spawn_one` a fresh launch uses,
//! killing through `host::kill_process_group`, and giving a stopped plugin's
//! serving thread the chance to run its own ordinary teardown rather than
//! being torn down from outside it. Keeping the decision here and the effect
//! there is what makes [`diff`] testable without a Deno interpreter, a
//! `bwrap`, or a running client at all.
//!
//! ## Why this reimplements `start_all`'s discovery rather than calling it
//!
//! `plugin_host::start_all` (in `cordial-runtime`) answers "what should run,
//! printed for a human watching a launch": built-in counts, shadow warnings,
//! "not granted" lines, one `println!` per decision. [`desired_state`] answers
//! the same question silently, because it runs once a second for the whole
//! life of the client and a launch-shaped log line repeated every tick would
//! drown the one thing worth reading in that log, which is a *change*.
//! `cordial-shell`'s `refresh_watch.rs` sets the precedent for keeping a
//! second, identically-shaped copy of a decision when the two callers
//! genuinely need different things from it (there: a Cargo dependency cycle;
//! here: silence) rather than forcing one shape to serve both. The resolution
//! rule itself -- system root first, then the user root skipping ids a
//! built-in already claims, unpacked plugins excluded -- is the same rule in
//! both places, and `plugin_host::start_all`'s own tests are what would catch
//! the two drifting on what a *fresh launch* does; [`tests`] below are what
//! would catch this file drifting on what a *hot swap* does.
//!
//! ## Why unpacked plugins are invisible here
//!
//! A `CORDIAL_UNPACKED_PLUGINS` entry already reloads on its own -- Deno's own
//! `--watch`, started by `sandbox::command` when `PluginProc::spawn_with` is
//! given `reload: true` -- and it does that by restarting the same process
//! Deno is already supervising, not by anything in this file. Two supervisors
//! deciding to restart the same plugin is not a sharper edge than one, it is
//! a race between them, so [`desired_state`] never returns an unpacked
//! plugin and the reconciler's own "what is running" snapshot must not
//! include one either -- see `cordial-runtime::plugin_host::start_reconciler`.
//!
//! ## Why a plugin with no capability is simply absent
//!
//! `start_all` never spawns a plugin whose grant set is empty, and says why
//! at launch: "no capabilities granted, not started". [`desired_state`]
//! applies the same test continuously rather than only once, so a plugin
//! whose last capability is revoked while it is already running is not a
//! distinct "stop because empty" case to handle -- it simply stops appearing
//! in the desired set, and [`diff`] reports that the same way it reports an
//! uninstall: the plugin the caller asked to keep running is no longer one
//! this profile is willing to run at all. A plugin that keeps at least one
//! capability through a change is never this file's business; the process
//! that is already running it discovers the new set on its own next request,
//! through `plugin_host::refresh_grant`'s existing `mtime` check, which this
//! module's [`Change::Regrant`] only exists to make *visible* in the log,
//! not to *cause*.
