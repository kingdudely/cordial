//! A `roblox-player://` link the desktop handed over, checked before it is
//! believed.
//!
//! Cordial registers as the handler for `roblox-player:` and `roblox:` in
//! `packaging/io.github.luohoa97.Cordial.desktop`, which is the thing Sober did and the
//! reason a Play button on the website has anywhere to go on this machine. What
//! arrives is a string produced by a browser acting on a click, so it is treated
//! as hostile input rather than as an instruction: nothing here builds a path
//! from it and nothing interpolates it into a shell string. Joins reach the
//! child through [`std::process::Command::arg`]. The optional browser-account
//! resolver extracts and consumes the authentication ticket before that handoff.
//!
//! Acceptance checks the scheme, length and printable bytes. Account routing
//! recognises a narrower desktop grammar separately. Ticket stripping preserves
//! recognised desktop fields; unknown field-like text inside `gameinfo` is
//! removed with the ticket rather than forwarded as a possible credential suffix.
//!
//! **`cordial_runtime::deeplink` checks the same three things again**, and the
//! duplication is deliberate rather than an oversight: `cordial-shell` does not
//! link the runtime at all — see `main.rs` — and the client has to refuse a bad
//! `--join-url` whatever started it, including a hand-typed one. What the two
//! must not do is disagree, because a link this accepts and the client refuses
//! is a launch that dies after the launcher has already said it was joining. So
//! the limit is 2048 bytes in both, the schemes are the same pair in both, and
//! both require printable ASCII.
