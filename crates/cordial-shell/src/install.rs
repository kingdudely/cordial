//! Where the Roblox build is, and how Cordial goes looking for one.
//!
//! Cordial ships no Roblox code and never will, so every launch depends on a
//! build the user already has. Nothing in this project used to record where
//! that was: the only way to run the client was a hand-typed `cordial-run`
//! command line carrying `--lib-dir` and `--apk`, which is why the chooser's
//! activate handler had nothing to call.
//!
//! The resolution order here is the same one `justfile`'s `dev` recipe uses,
//! deliberately and to the letter, because that recipe has been run end to end
//! and this had not. Two things in it are not guessable and both cost somebody
//! an afternoon to establish:
//!
//! The engine is **not in `base.apk`** on a split build. `libroblox.so` lives
//! in `split_config.x86_64.apk` beside it, so anything that assumes the APK it
//! was given contains the engine fails on the ordinary case. Each candidate is
//! tried in turn instead of one being asserted.
//!
//! And the extracted engine belongs in the cache rather than beside the APK,
//! because the APK is usually inside another application's data directory,
//! which Cordial has no business writing into.
//!
//! **Detection is a filesystem check every time, never a remembered answer.**
//! A stored "yes, it is installed" goes stale the moment the user deletes the
//! build or Sober replaces it, and a launcher that then fails with a path
//! error is worse than one that simply looks again.
//!
//! And the extracted engine is **stamped with the APK it came from**. Presence
//! alone was the whole test until now, which meant a new Roblox build left the
//! *old* engine in the cache and Cordial ran it against the new APK's assets —
//! a silent version mismatch, and worse than the cold start the cache exists to
//! avoid, because nothing about it presents as a caching problem. `justfile`'s
//! `client` recipe had the same bug and had it fixed; this had not.
//! [`cordial_update::cache`] owns the stamp and writes the same string that
//! recipe writes, so the two never make each other re-extract 115 MB.
