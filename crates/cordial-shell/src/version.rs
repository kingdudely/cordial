//! What version this is, and which build of it.
//!
//! **Two facts, not one, and the mistake was treating them as alternatives.**
//! The version is what the manifest says and is the thing anything ordering two
//! releases compares. The commit is provenance: it answers "which exact build
//! is this" in a bug report and nothing else.
//!
//! Before this split, `build.rs` stamped `git describe --tags --always --dirty`
//! as the version, which meant a tree whose `Cargo.toml` said 0.11.0 displayed
//! `0.10.0-26-g571e69b-dirty` -- the *previous* release. Meanwhile
//! `cordial-update`'s User-Agent has always been built from
//! `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, so the same binary told a mirror it was 0.11.0 while
//! its title bar said 0.10.0. Two numbers that can disagree eventually do.
//!
//! [`GIT_SHA`] is `option_env!` rather than `env!` deliberately: an AUR source
//! package, a `cargo publish`, a vendored build and the Flatpak's `type: dir`
//! source all arrive without a usable `.git`, and none of them should fail to
//! compile over it. They get a clean [`VERSION`] and no commit, which is the
//! correct answer rather than a degraded one.
