//! The Roblox-build button in the header bar, and the settings that govern it.
//!
//! `docs/design/updating-roblox.md` specifies a button whose icon says which of
//! three states it is in, and all three are built here. What is **not** built,
//! because it does not exist to build, is the fetch behind them: Roblox
//! publishes no Android download. `client-version/AndroidApp` answers HTTP 500
//! while `WindowsPlayer` answers 200, `setup.rbxcdn.com/android/DeployHistory.txt`
//! is 403, and `roblox.com/download` offers Google Play and the Amazon Appstore
//! and no file. [`cordial_update::download::Source::official`] is a refusal for
//! that reason, and ADR-015 accepted it.
//!
//! So every control here stops short of claiming a download. The Update button
//! exists, in the state that earns it, and what it opens says where the build
//! comes from — because a control that looked live and could never fire would be
//! AGENTS.md's stub-that-lies wearing a widget: something proceeds on an answer
//! that is not true, except here the something is a person. This project has
//! already shipped a settings page describing plugins nobody had installed,
//! twice.
//!
//! ## One question, one button, and no second APK picker
//!
//! The window behind the header-bar button offered the APK picker as well, and
//! that picker is gone rather than kept in two places. `profile_switcher.rs`
//! states the rule it broke: *two ways to set one value drift, and the one that
//! drifts is the one nobody is looking at.* Choosing a build is configuration
//! and lives on the Roblox page in Settings beside the engine directory it has
//! to agree with; this window answers the one question a header-bar button can
//! answer on its own — which build am I on, and has Roblox published a newer
//! engine — and offers the single control that state earns.
//!
//! The settings themselves moved too, off the Roblox page and onto one of their
//! own. That page was answering "where is the build" and "when does the build
//! change" at once, which is six lines of description and a warning row on top
//! of the two rows somebody opened it for.
//!
//! ## How "there is an update" is established without a version endpoint
//!
//! [`cordial_update::changelog`] is the half that works: Roblox's release notes
//! are titled `Release Notes for NNN`, and `NNN` is the engine major — the `732`
//! in `0.732.23.7321040` and the `Version=732` the client logs about itself. So
//! the newest release-notes major is the newest engine Roblox has shipped, and
//! comparing it against the version of the build *here* is a real comparison.
//!
//! The catch is the other operand. Cordial knows the installed version only for
//! a build it fetched itself ([`cordial_update::cache::recorded_version`]), and
//! it has fetched none — an APK somebody obtained elsewhere carries no version
//! this can read without parsing Android's binary manifest. So the ordinary
//! state is **not knowing**, and the button says exactly that rather than
//! rounding it to "up to date". Telling somebody they are current while Roblox
//! refuses their build server-side is the failure this whole feature exists to
//! prevent.
//!
//! ## Always present, immediately left of Settings
//!
//! The design's argument, unchanged and for its original reason: a control that
//! comes and goes is hard to find at the moment you want it, and it moves
//! everything beside it when it arrives. The version-and-changelog view is
//! useful on its own, which is why the nothing-newer state is not a dead end.
//!
//! The check runs on a thread of its own, started once the window is up. That is
//! the one hard requirement in the design rather than a preference: `http`'s
//! timeout is twenty seconds, and twenty seconds of a frozen launcher is what a
//! call on the GTK thread buys.
