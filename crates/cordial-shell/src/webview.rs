//! The in-experience web window, as a dialog attached to the client.
//!
//! Roblox keeps a browser inside itself. Account settings, buying Robux, the
//! sign-in flow and anything else the client does not render natively all open
//! one of these. Without it those buttons do nothing at all — no window, no
//! error, no log line.
//!
//! Informed by mocktail's implementation, Copyright 2026 komaruworld,
//! Apache-2.0 — see `NOTICE` and `third_party/mocktail-webview/`. The security
//! rules are theirs and live in [`crate::webview_policy`]; this file is Cordial's
//! own window and does not share their structure. Apache-2.0 section 4(b): a
//! derived work, saying so.
//!
//! ## Why a dialog rather than a window
//!
//! Because the protocol says so, once you read what it asks for. The engine
//! exports `getHideHeaderKey`, `getShowDomainAsTitleKey` and
//! `getBackButtonVisibleKey` — that is chrome for a view embedded in an app with
//! a header bar that can be suppressed, not for a browser window. On Android
//! these are in-app overlays and never separate tasks.
//!
//! An `AdwDialog` is the same thing on this desktop: attached to the client
//! window, adaptive, and dismissed by the gesture every other GNOME sheet uses.
//! A second top-level would land wherever the compositor decided, which this
//! project has already fought once over the engine canvas.
//!
//! **This choice held up, but needed a partner fix to actually be visible.**
//! An `AdwDialog` "draws inside its parent's own surface" — true, and still
//! true below — but that surface is the same `wl_surface` the engine's own
//! canvas is a `wl_subsurface` of, per ADR-011, and a subsurface's default
//! stacking is *above* its parent. So a dialog opened here rendered correctly
//! from the moment this file was written, and was invisible from the same
//! moment, painted into a surface the engine was compositing over every
//! frame — reported as "the whole window goes white/blank", which reads as
//! this window failing to open at all rather than as a stacking order one
//! layer up from it. `crates/cordial-runtime/src/android/wayland.rs`'s
//! `WaylandWindow::webview_dialog_opened`/`webview_dialog_closed` is the fix:
//! it lowers the engine's subsurface behind `parent_surface` for as long as a
//! dialog from [`open`] is up. Nothing in *this* file changed for it, because
//! the stacking is entirely a property of the engine's own subsurface, which
//! this crate has no handle to — see that module's own doc for the mechanism
//! and why a nested-compositor screenshot missed it the first time.
//!
//! ## Why in-process, when mocktail's helper is not
//!
//! Checked directly against `webview_helper_launcher.cc` before writing this,
//! because the filename is a real architectural claim and deserved reading
//! rather than assuming. What it shows: mocktail's helper is a second
//! `posix_spawn`ed binary talking to the first over a `SOCK_SEQPACKET`
//! control channel it hand-rolls (`MOCKTAIL-WEBVIEW 1`, `MWVC`/`MWVE` framed
//! packets) — real process isolation, built because mocktail's engine process
//! is C++ over SDL3 and carries **no GTK at all**. Adding a browser to that
//! process would mean linking GTK, WebKitGTK and libadwaita into a process
//! that currently has none of them, for a feature the engine process itself
//! never needs to touch.
//!
//! That reasoning does not transfer. [ADR-011](../../../docs/adr/ADR-011-wayland-and-libadwaita.md)
//! already put GTK4 and libadwaita in Cordial's engine process, unconditionally,
//! for a reason that has nothing to do with web views: the engine's `wl_surface`
//! is a `wl_subsurface` of the GTK toplevel, and a Wayland subsurface cannot
//! parent across a process boundary, so "one connection, therefore one
//! process" was decided before this module existed. Cordial does not choose
//! between one GTK process and none — it is already one GTK process, and a
//! `WebKitWebView` in that process is a widget, not a second toolkit.
//! `docs/analysis/webview-surface.md` §5 reaches the same conclusion by
//! reading the WebKitGTK API surface rather than mocktail's launcher, and is
//! the fuller writeup; this file's summary and that document should not be
//! allowed to drift apart.
//!
//! What actually isolates page content — the process boundary mocktail's
//! helper buys by being a separate binary — Cordial gets for free from
//! **WebKitGTK's own multi-process model**: a `WebKitWebView` is a widget, and
//! the page itself runs in `WebKitWebProcess` and `WebKitNetworkProcess` under
//! WebKit's own sandbox, maintained by people who do it full time. A
//! hand-rolled helper would add a second IPC layer on top of that for
//! isolation already present, and it would cost the attached dialog, because a
//! separate process cannot present one — `AdwDialog` is not a second
//! `xdg_toplevel` to begin with; it is drawn inside its parent's own surface
//! (libadwaita's dialog host, not a second `GdkSurface`), so there is no
//! second Wayland connection here for a helper process to avoid fighting over.
//!
//! **What would change this**, stated the way ADR-011 states its own
//! reversal condition: if WebKit's own process crashes started taking Cordial
//! down with them, that would be a measurement, not a prediction, and nothing
//! here has measured it — recorded in `docs/analysis/webview-surface.md` §5
//! and repeated here so it is not lost if this file is read on its own.
//!
//! What is *not* skipped, and is the one thing mocktail's shape and this one
//! agree on without qualification: **every bridge message is origin-checked**.
//! This window is where a user signs in and where payment happens, so a page
//! able to post arbitrary commands at the engine is the whole security
//! boundary. Every navigation goes through [`crate::webview_policy::evaluate`]
//! before it is allowed, and — see [`open`]'s bridge handler below — every
//! bridge message is checked again, against the page's *current* address, not
//! the one it was granted the bridge for; a page can navigate itself
//! unprivileged after loading privileged, and mocktail's own
//! `IsPrivilegedBridgeAllowed` re-reads `webkit_web_view_get_uri` for exactly
//! that reason. This file does the same, at the same point.

    // calls. Policy is still re-checked against the live uri on every message,
    // because this necessarily runs in the page's own world.
