//! Stamping the extracted engine with the APK it came from.
//!
//! `~/.cache/cordial/lib/x86_64` holds `libroblox.so`, pulled out of whichever
//! APK the user has. It is usually a symlink into the keyed store now
//! ([`crate::store`], ADR-033), and the stamp travels with the entry. **Presence alone used to be the whole test**, which meant a
//! new Roblox build left the *old* engine in place and Cordial ran it against
//! the new APK's assets — a silent version mismatch, which is worse than the
//! cold start the cache exists to avoid, because nothing about it presents as a
//! caching problem.
//!
//! `justfile`'s `client` recipe had exactly this bug and had it fixed; the shell
//! did not, and ran the stale engine. This is the fix in code, and it writes
//! **the same stamp string the recipe writes**, deliberately:
//!
//! ```text
//! stamp="$cache/.from"
//! want="$(stat -c '%s %Y %n' "$apk")"
//! ```
//!
//! Size, mtime in seconds, path — separated by single spaces, no trailing
//! newline. Not because either has to read the other's file, but because they
//! share one cache directory, and two formats in one file means `just client`
//! and the shell each see the other's stamp as a change and re-extract 115 MB in
//! turn, for as long as somebody alternates between them. Where they can still
//! disagree is the path: `stat`'s `%n` prints the path as it was given, so a
//! relative `--apk base.apk` stamps differently from the shell's absolute path.
//! The cost of that is one extra extraction, which is the safe direction.
//!
//! **The mtime is deliberately not read off the extracted file.** Zip preserves
//! the timestamp stored in the archive, so an engine extracted this morning has
//! an mtime somewhere in 1981 and comparing it to anything is meaningless.
//!
//! Size and mtime rather than a hash of the APK: hashing 115 MB on every launch
//! to answer "has this changed" costs about half a second of a cold start to
//! detect a case — same size, same mtime, different contents — that means
//! somebody deliberately forged a timestamp. [`crate::download`] hashes what it
//! fetched, which is where a hash actually protects something.
