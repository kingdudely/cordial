//! The build that is already on this machine.
//!
//! **This is the source most users should end up on, and it is the cheapest
//! thing in the crate.** It makes no request, discloses nothing to anybody,
//! costs no bytes on a metered connection, and finishes in the time it takes to
//! read a version string out of a library. It exists because of an observation
//! that is easy to miss while designing a downloader: a large share of the
//! people who will run Cordial have already downloaded this exact file, and
//! the README told them to.
//!
//! Sober is why. It fetches the Android build through Google Play on the user's
//! own account and leaves it in a predictable place, Cordial's quickstart names
//! that place, and this crate has been reading `libroblox.so` out of it since
//! [`crate::engine`] was written. The file is already there. Fetching a second
//! copy of it from a third-party mirror would be worse in every dimension --
//! slower, more exposed, and no more trustworthy, since both copies get the
//! same signature check anyway.
//!
//! ## What this provider does not do
//!
//! It does not copy Sober's file into Cordial's cache and it does not read
//! anything of Sober's but this one archive, which is Roblox's rather than
//! Sober's. It takes no configuration from Sober, touches none of its state,
//! and is unaffected by whether Sober is running.
//!
//! It also does not trust the file for being local. Being on the disk already
//! is a statement about convenience and not about provenance -- the path is
//! under `$HOME` and anything running as the user could have written it -- so
//! an archive obtained *through this provider* goes through exactly the same
//! [`crate::apk_signature`] check as one off a mirror, in
//! [`crate::provider::obtain_from`]. A local file that fails that check is
//! refused with the same words.
//!
//! **That is true of this provider and was not true of the path the launcher
//! actually uses**, which is the correction this paragraph carries rather than
//! the claim it used to make. `cordial_shell::install::locate` finds a build
//! from the environment, the APK chosen in Settings, or Sober's directory and
//! returns it without asking this crate to verify anything -- nothing in
//! `cordial-shell` calls [`crate::apk_signature`] at all. A comment stating a
//! security property the launch path does not have is worse than no comment,
//! so it is scoped here to what it covers. See issue #51.
//!
//! ## Where it looks
//!
//! `CORDIAL_APK_DIR` first, so somebody who has an APK of their own can say so
//! without editing anything. Then Sober's package directory, in both the
//! Flatpak location and the native one, because Sober ships as both and the
//! two are not the same path.
