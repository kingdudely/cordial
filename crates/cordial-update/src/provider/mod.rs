//! Where the Roblox build comes from, as a set of interchangeable sources.
//!
//! [ADR-015](../../../docs/adr/ADR-015-fetching-the-roblox-build.md) permits
//! Cordial to download the official build to the user's own machine and never
//! to ship one, and for a long time this crate could honour the first half only
//! in theory: Roblox publishes no Android download, so
//! [`crate::download::Source::official`] refuses in three plain sentences and
//! the user was left to find an APK themselves. That is the single largest
//! thing standing between somebody and a working client, and it is the reason
//! the quickstart's first instruction is to install a different program.
//!
//! [ADR-025](../../../docs/adr/ADR-025-fetching-from-a-third-party-mirror.md)
//! is what changed. It permits a distributor who is not Roblox, on one
//! condition, and the condition is the whole of it: the archive is worthless
//! until [`crate::apk_signature`] says Roblox's own signing certificate signed
//! those exact bytes. A mirror that alters a byte is caught; a mirror that
//! serves something else entirely is caught; a mirror that is compromised is
//! caught. What a mirror can still do is go down, lie about what versions
//! exist, or watch who asks -- which is why the choice of source is the user's
//! and why the one that needs no network is tried first.
//!
//! ## Two axes of extension, and they are not the same axis
//!
//! Conflating them is easy and it produces the wrong design, so they are named
//! separately here.
//!
//! **Same protocol, different host** is configuration, not code:
//! `CORDIAL_MIRROR_URL` points [`mirror`] at any endpoint that answers in
//! APKPure's shape -- a caching proxy, a copy inside a company network, a
//! different deployment of the same software. Nothing is compiled for it.
//!
//! **A different protocol is a new [`Provider`]**, because APKMirror, F-Droid
//! and Aptoide do not merely live at other addresses: they enumerate versions
//! differently, hand back download URLs differently, and in two of those cases
//! are not machine-readable at all without scraping HTML. No base URL bridges
//! that. A new source is a new file in this directory and a line in [`all`],
//! and the trait exists so that it is only those two things.
//!
//! That is also why this is a trait rather than a function with a `match` in
//! it. [`local`] reads a file already on the disk and touches no network;
//! [`mirror`] speaks an undocumented binary protocol to a third party and
//! validates every URL it is handed. They share an output type and nothing
//! else, and one function covering both would be a long `if` whose branches
//! never meet.
//!
//! ## What a new provider is not allowed to do, and what enforces it
//!
//! **A provider returns bytes. It never returns trust.** It does not verify a
//! signature, does not decide what is installable, and does not put anything
//! anywhere but the directory it was handed. [`obtain`] performs the signature
//! check on whatever comes back, from every source, without asking the source
//! whether it thinks that is necessary.
//!
//! This is the property that makes adding a source cheap. A second mirror buys
//! *availability* and nothing else -- the signature check is what makes any
//! source acceptable at all, so another one adds no trust and removes no risk,
//! and the bar for adding one is correspondingly low. It is also the property
//! most easily lost by accident, by a provider that "helpfully" checks its own
//! download and a later refactor that takes [`obtain`]'s check out as
//! duplicated work.
//!
//! So it is tested against a deliberately hostile provider rather than
//! documented and hoped for: see `a_hostile_provider_cannot_get_anything_past_the_check`.
//!
//! ## The order matters and is not alphabetical
//!
//! [`all`] returns the zero-network source first. On a machine that already has
//! the build -- which is most machines that have ever run Sober, and Sober is
//! what the README tells people to install -- the whole of [`mirror`] is
//! skipped: no request, no third party, no 150 MB, and nothing for a metered
//! connection to object to. Reaching the network to fetch a file that is
//! already present would be the worst version of this feature.
