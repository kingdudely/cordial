//! Fetching the build from APKPure, a mirror that is not Roblox.
//!
//! [ADR-025](../../../docs/adr/ADR-025-fetching-from-a-third-party-mirror.md)
//! is the decision and it turns on one sentence:
//! [`crate::apk_signature`] verifies that Roblox's own signing certificate
//! signed these exact bytes, so a mirror cannot alter the file it serves
//! without the alteration being caught. That check is not a formality bolted on
//! afterwards -- **it is the entire reason this file is allowed to exist**, and
//! a caller that fetches through here and skips it has not saved a step, it has
//! removed the only thing that made the source acceptable.
//!
//! What the check does not cover is worth naming, because it is what the user
//! is actually deciding about when they choose this source. A mirror can be
//! down. A mirror can decline to serve a version, or serve an older one while
//! claiming it is current -- **nothing here verifies the version list**, only
//! the archives. And a mirror sees who asked and when. Those are the terms, and
//! they are why [`super::local`] is tried first and why this is not the default
//! on a metered connection.
//!
//! ## The protocol has no specification, and this is a reader for it
//!
//! The endpoint answers with a length-delimited binary encoding that is
//! protocol-buffer-shaped and has no published schema, no `.proto`, and no
//! promise of stability. There is no way to parse it correctly in the sense
//! that word usually means; what there is, is a set of byte patterns that hold
//! on the responses this has been measured against. That makes the reader below
//! **a maintenance surface**, and the only thing that makes a maintenance
//! surface maintainable is a record of what it looked like when it worked.
//!
//! Measured on 2026-08-26 from this machine, `x-abis: x86_64`:
//!
//! ```text
//! HTTP/2 200, 99 073 bytes
//! 15 version markers, newest first
//! newest              2.734.917, version code 2908
//! its download        https://download.pureapk.com/b/APK/...  (a single APK)
//! second marker       2.734.916, code 2904
//! ```
//!
//! The engine already installed on that machine reads `2.734.0.917`, which is
//! the same build from a source that shares no code with this one. That
//! agreement is the control: a reader that mis-parsed the response would have
//! to mis-parse it into the right answer to pass it.
//!
//! ## The download, measured the same day
//!
//! `cargo run --release -p cordial-update --example fetch_probe -- --download`:
//!
//! ```text
//! candidate-0.apk   229 140 095 bytes, one monolithic APK
//! contents          3578 entries, 1835 under assets/,
//!                   lib/{arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,x86_64}/libroblox.so
//! verified          44932ea35a17a267372d71b54d1a0cb3da0dca5113e94406ae2fe18090ba1477
//! ```
//!
//! **That fingerprint is the same one the archive Sober downloaded from Google
//! Play carries**, and the two files are not the same file: 229 MB of every
//! ABI against 97 MB of assets plus a 53 MB x86-64 split. Two distribution
//! routes that share nothing, one signing certificate, and this verifier saying
//! so about both.
//!
//! That is the strongest statement available about whether the mirror is
//! serving Roblox's build, and it is the measurement to repeat when anyone asks
//! whether this source is safe. It is also, precisely, the thing ADR-025 said
//! had to be true.
//!
//! ## Three field tags do all the work
//!
//! Naming them makes the scan below legible rather than magical.
//!
//! | Byte | Protobuf meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `0x2a` | field 5, length-delimited -- the version code, ASCII decimal |
//! | `0x32` | field 6 -- the version name, ASCII |
//! | `0x3a` | field 7 -- whatever follows the name; its tag is the ASCII colon the scan anchors on |
//! | `0x4a` | field 9 -- a download URL |
//!
//! Lengths are single-byte varints except in the URLs, which is why every
//! length check here is against a value under 128 and the URL length is two
//! bytes.
//!
//! ## Nothing downstream trusts this about architecture
//!
//! The ABI filter is a hint to the service and not a fact about what arrives.
//! The archive is opened and [`crate::apk::LIBRARY_IN_APK`] (the host's own
//! library path -- `lib/x86_64/libroblox.so` on an x86-64 build,
//! `lib/arm64-v8a/libroblox.so` on aarch64) is looked for directly, which is
//! why the broad-filter retry is safe: widening it buys availability and
//! cannot buy a wrong answer.

/// the honest version of "an APKPure-compatible endpoint". The response is an
/// undocumented, length-delimited binary blob with no schema and no `.proto`,
/// read by the byte patterns below. Anything answering here has to produce that
/// exact shape. So this is the same bargain as pointing an OpenAI client at a
/// different base URL -- the wire format is fixed and the host is yours, be it
/// a mirror, a caching proxy in front of APKPure, or a copy inside a company
/// network -- and it is not a plugin interface for arbitrary services.
///
/// Saying that plainly matters more than it looks. A setting called "mirror
/// URL" invites somebody to paste an F-Droid or Aptoide address, get a reader
/// that finds no version markers, and read the failure as Cordial being broken.

///
/// ## Why this is allowed to widen the allow-list
///
/// [`crate::url_policy`] exists to stop the *mirror* sending Cordial somewhere
/// of its own choosing, and it still does: every redirect is re-checked and an
/// unlisted target is refused. What changes is who writes the list, and that is
/// now the user -- who could replace the binary anyway, and who is the one
/// person entitled to decide which third party they talk to.
///
/// **The property that actually protects them is untouched.** Whatever host
/// serves the archive, it installs only if Roblox's own signing certificate
/// signed those exact bytes. A hostile base URL can waste bandwidth, watch who
/// asked, and serve nothing installable. It cannot serve a modified Roblox.
/// That is why a mirror was acceptable at all, and it does not care which one.
