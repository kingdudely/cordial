//! The build directory Cordial owns, and filling it.
//!
//! Until now the only build Cordial could run was one somebody else had put
//! somewhere: in practice Sober's, at
//! `~/.var/app/org.vinegarhq.Sober/data/sober/packages/x86_64/com.roblox.client/`.
//! That works and it is not going away as a *place to read from*, but it means
//! Cordial only runs if a different Roblox launcher is installed and has
//! already downloaded something. This module is the other half: one directory
//! Cordial owns, that Cordial can fill.
//!
//! ## Read anywhere, write in one place
//!
//! [`build_dir`] is under the user's cache and is the only directory anything
//! here writes an APK into. A user may point Cordial at a build wherever they
//! like and it will be read; if they point it inside another application's
//! Flatpak data, a download **diverts** to [`build_dir`] rather than writing
//! there ([`Destination`]). Writing into somebody else's install is not ours to
//! do, and quietly replacing Sober's copy would break Sober.
//!
//! ADR-015 is the other half of that sentence: what lands here came from the
//! user's own request, stays on the user's own machine, and is never re-served.
//!
//! ## Both halves, and the trap
//!
//! **`base.apk` does not contain the engine.** On a split build `libroblox.so`
//! is in `split_config.x86_64.apk` beside it, and anything that fetches "the
//! APK" and stops has fetched the half without the engine in it. Both names are
//! constants here, [`Parts`](crate::download::Parts) carries both, and
//! [`install_into`] refuses if no part it fetched holds
//! [`apk::LIBRARY_IN_APK`] — naming the split, because that refusal is the one
//! somebody will meet and the sentence they need is which file is missing.
//!
//! Assets come out of `base.apk` at runtime and the engine comes out of the
//! split, so both are kept rather than the engine being extracted and the
//! archives thrown away.
//!
//! ## The extracted engine stays where it is
//!
//! [`engine_dir`] is `~/.cache/cordial/lib/x86_64`, unchanged and deliberately
//! not moved under [`build_dir`]. Three things already agree on that path —
//! `justfile`'s recipes, `cordial-shell`'s `install::engine_cache`, and every
//! working install on a contributor's machine — and moving it would buy tidiness
//! at the cost of invalidating all of them at once. They are siblings under one
//! cache root, which is what the swap below needs: a rename between them stays
//! on one filesystem.
//!
//! Since ADR-033 that path is a symlink into `builds/<version>/` whenever the
//! version is known, so anything that writes to it writes into a kept build.
//! [`adopt`] detaches the link before extracting and keys the result after.
//!
//! ## Nothing replaces a working build until the replacement is complete
//!
//! The worst failure this feature can produce is somebody losing the client they
//! had because a download was interrupted. So the order is: fetch every part
//! into a staging directory, verify each against its published hash, check each
//! as a zip against ADR-014's refusals, extract the engine out of the staged
//! archive — and only then move anything into place. Every failure before that
//! last step leaves the previous build exactly as it was.
//!
//! Two things move into place, separately, and each is made safe for a
//! different reason.
//!
//! **The engine** is a single rename from the directory it was extracted into
//! onto [`engine_dir`], so it is atomic on its own. The cache stamp is cleared
//! *before* that rename rather than after, so a process killed on either side
//! of it leaves a cache that re-extracts on the next launch rather than an
//! engine claiming to belong to archives it does not match — the pairing bug
//! [`cache`](crate::cache) exists for.
//!
//! **The two archives are not one rename**, and an earlier version of this
//! swapped them one after the other with nothing to undo the first if the
//! second failed — a process killed, or simply a copy that ran out of disk,
//! between the two could leave an engine's carrier from one build sitting
//! beside assets from another, on disk, with the marker and the (by-then
//! cleared) stamp giving no sign anything was wrong. `adopt`'s `swap_archives`
//! step fixes that by preparing every archive fully inside a directory of its
//! own, off to the side of anything live, before touching `build` at all, and
//! then promoting the whole set with each promoted file's previous content
//! kept until every other file has landed too — so a failure partway through
//! puts back what had already been swapped, and `build` ends up wholly the old
//! pair or wholly the new one. What that cannot close is a kill landing in the
//! gap between one rename syscall and the next during promotion itself; on one
//! filesystem, without a further directory indirection this crate does not
//! add, no set of plain renames can.
