//! Keeping more than one Roblox build, and choosing between them.
//!
//! There was one slot. `~/.cache/cordial/lib/<abi>` held one `libroblox.so`
//! and a stamp naming the APK it came out of, and a new build overwrote the
//! old one. That is fine until a Roblox build regresses, and then it is the
//! whole problem: the engine is the one component nobody here controls, and a
//! user whose game stopped working had no way back short of finding an APK
//! themselves.
//!
//! So the slot becomes a store. `~/.cache/cordial/builds/<version>/` holds the
//! extracted library and its stamp, and the old single-slot path becomes a
//! symlink into whichever entry is current. Everything that already computes
//! that path -- `justfile`, `cordial-shell`'s `install::engine_cache`,
//! `cordial_update::install::engine_dir`, and every `--lib-dir` anybody has
//! typed -- keeps working without being told, because a symlink is a directory
//! to everything that opens a file through it.
//! [ADR-033](../../../docs/adr/ADR-033-roblox-versions-are-a-keyed-store.md)
//! records the decision and what it deliberately leaves out.
//!
//! **The version is a directory name, and it comes from scanning a binary.**
//! [`crate::engine::scan`] finds it by looking for a plausible run of digits
//! and dots in `libroblox.so`, which is a heuristic over bytes Cordial did not
//! write. Anything derived that way and then joined onto a path is a directory
//! traversal waiting to be reported as one, so [`is_valid_version`] is checked
//! at every entry point here rather than trusted to a caller -- and it is a
//! whitelist of digits and dots, not a blacklist of `..`.
//!
//! **Ordering is component-wise and numeric, never lexicographic.** Roblox's
//! versions look like `2.738.0.1393`, and sorted as strings `2.99` comes after
//! `2.738` -- so a store sorted the obvious way offers the wrong build as the
//! newest, and prunes the right one. That is a one-line bug with a
//! months-later symptom.
