//! The one HTTP client this crate uses, and the two things it is configured for.
//!
//! **Status codes are not errors.** ureq turns 4xx and 5xx into `Err` by
//! default and throws the body away with them, and the body is where Roblox
//! says what went wrong: `AndroidApp` answers
//! `{"errors":[{"code":3,"message":"Error while fetching version information."}]}`
//! with an HTTP 500, and `AndroidPlayer` answers `"Invalid binaryType."` with a
//! 400. Those two are a Roblox outage and a name Cordial got wrong, and a
//! fetcher that cannot tell them apart makes whoever maintains this guess.
//!
//! **Cordial says it is Cordial.** ADR-015 is explicit that this never pretends
//! to be the official client, and a request with no user agent at all is a
//! smaller lie than a copied one but is still not an answer. There is nothing
//! to gain by hiding: the file is public and the endpoints are public.
//!
//! **Redirects are walked and re-checked, the same as a mirror's.** This used
//! to hand `url` straight to a plain `ureq::Agent` with `https_only` unset and
//! ureq's own default of ten redirects left in place -- no per-hop host check
//! at all, on every request this file makes, unlike [`crate::url_policy`],
//! which this same crate built precisely so a redirect could not walk a
//! request off the host it was sent to. Every URL here is a compile-time
//! constant naming `clientsettingscdn.roblox.com`, `devforum.roblox.com` or
//! `create.roblox.com`, so the request itself was never the risk; a redirect
//! is, and the fix is the same one `mirror` already needed: follow it by hand
//! and require every hop to stay on the host the request started on.
