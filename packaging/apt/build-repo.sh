# Build a signed APT repository from one or more already-built .deb files.
#
# This is Cordial's own repository -- the analogue of
# packaging/cordial.flatpakrepo and packaging/build-flatpak.sh for `apt
# install` rather than `flatpak install`. It does not build Cordial and does
# not build a .deb; packaging/deb/build-deb.sh already does that, and this
# script's whole job starts after that one's is finished. See
# docs/design/apt-repository.md for what this is, what it deliberately is
# not (an upload to Debian proper), and the procedure for the key.
#
# Usage:
#     packaging/apt/build-repo.sh [--outdir DIR] [--allow-unsigned] DEB [DEB...]
#
# Signing is driven by APT_GPG_KEY_ID, the fingerprint of a secret key
# already present in the calling GNUPGHOME -- this script never imports a
# key itself, the same division flatpak.yml's "Import the signing key" step
# and this script's own caller keep: importing is CI's job (or a
# maintainer's, by hand), signing-with-an-ID-that's-already-there is this
# script's. Without APT_GPG_KEY_ID set, the script refuses outright rather
# than writing a Packages/Release tree that has every file an installable
# repository needs except the one that makes it trustworthy -- a thing that
# *looks* finished is worse here than a thing that visibly is not, and an
# apt repository with no signature only works at all if a user adds
# `[trusted=yes]`, which is a worse thing to hand someone than an error
# message. --allow-unsigned overrides that refusal, loudly, for testing the
# tree shape on a machine with no key -- see the README note beside it below.
#
# Needs: ar, tar, gzip, and a checksum tool (sha256sum/md5sum -- GNU
# coreutils; this script does not attempt the BSD/macOS equivalents because
# nothing else in packaging/ runs there either). gpg only when signing.
# apt-ftparchive, from Debian/Ubuntu's apt-utils package, is used when
# present and produces byte-for-byte the same tool real Debian mirrors use;
# where it is absent (this repository's own development host is Fedora
# Silverblue, which carries no Debian packaging tools at all and cannot
# gain them without an rpm-ostree rebuild and a reboot -- see AGENTS.md's
# note on gdb for the same constraint) the script falls back to a short
# hand-rolled equivalent using ar/tar/gzip/sha256sum, which is what this
# script has actually been exercised against: see the report for this
# change for the synthetic-.deb run that verified it end to end. Both
# branches scan the whole pool/ tree rather than just the .debs passed to
# this invocation -- an earlier version of the hand-rolled branch did not,
# and so disagreed with apt-ftparchive about which packages a second release
# should list; see the "reading control stanzas from the pool" step below,
# which is what keeps that from recurring.
#
# **The apt-ftparchive branch is therefore INFERRED, not verified** -- it has
# passed `bash -n` and a read-through against apt-ftparchive(1), not a run,
# because no host available while writing this had the tool installed.
# CI's ubuntu container installs apt-utils specifically so that branch gets
# exercised for real the first time this runs there; if it is ever wrong,
# CI is where that will show, not here.

# SUITE and COMPONENT are still fixed rather than flags: this repository has
# one suite and one component today, and the brief that produced this script
# names dists/stable/ specifically. Widen these into flags the day a second
# suite (e.g. an unstable/nightly channel) is actually wanted -- there is no
# reason to carry the option before there is a caller for it.
#
# ARCH is no longer fixed. It used to be, on the same "widen it the day a
# second one is wanted" reasoning -- that day is release.yml's `deb` job
# gaining an aarch64 leg, so this script now reads each .deb's own
# Architecture field instead of asserting one and refusing the rest. See the

This script refuses to build an apt repository with no signature, because an
unsigned one still produces every file `apt` needs to install from it -- the
only difference is that a user has to write [trusted=yes] into their
sources.list to use it, and this script is not going to be the thing that
makes that look like the normal path.

Import a signing key into this GNUPGHOME first (see
docs/design/apt-repository.md for the full procedure -- it mirrors
docs/design/flatpak-remote-signing.md) and set APT_GPG_KEY_ID to its
fingerprint, or pass --allow-unsigned to build the tree anyway, for
checking the layout on a machine with no key. A tree built with
--allow-unsigned is for your own inspection; publishing it is the one thing
--allow-unsigned does not make acceptable.
