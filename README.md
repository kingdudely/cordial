## Why Cordial

I used Sober for a year, and it worked really well. Cordial started off as a weekend project because I was bored, and I believe a project like this is something people have the right to read, modify, and learn from.

## Status

Experimental. Full table in [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md).

**Works:** loading an experience, sign-in, keyboard and mouse, camera, text
entry with IME preedit, audio, voice chat, pointer capture, fullscreen, two
accounts side by side, asset overlays, joining a public server from a game's
Servers list ([#40](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/40)). Private
servers are untested — none was reachable without a purchase.

**Known broken**, with issue numbers:

| | |
|---|---|
| No window at all on COSMIC, KWin, wlroots compositors | [#38](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/38) |
| Crash after second launch | [#44](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/44) |
| Fullscreen freezes; exiting it crashes | [#39](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/39) |
| Touchscreen input crashes immediately | [#36](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/36) |
| SIGSEGV on launch on some machines | [#35](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/35) |
| Client can hang on exit | [#52](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/52) |
| Pointer lock unconfirmed on Hyprland, cursor drifts | [#56](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/56) |
| Keyboard stops after another app takes focus | [#31](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/31) |
| Camera-sensitivity text box glitches the client | [#53](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/53) |
| X11 camera snaps 180 degrees | [#41](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/41) |

Controller buttons and sticks work; the brand of glyph Roblox draws may be
wrong ([`docs/controllers.md`](docs/controllers.md)). No force feedback.

Frame-rate numbers are not quoted here because the two measurements in this
repo contradict each other; see [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md).

**Tested platforms.** Development happens on Fedora with GNOME and Mesa. There
is no systematic test matrix — other compositors and GPU vendors are reported
working or broken through issues, not verified here.

<!-- TODO(neil): a supported-platforms table needs a real test pass first. Nothing in the repo supports one today. -->

## How it works

Cordial mmaps and relocates Roblox's unmodified `libroblox.so` with a ported
AOSP bionic linker rather than the system one. Every symbol the engine imports
resolves as **cordial** (an Android behaviour implemented here), **host**
(forwarded to glibc), or **stub** — and a stub reports failure rather than
faking success, so a gap stays visible instead of surfacing later as an
unrelated bug. `libjnivm` stands in for Android's ART, and a framework layer
answers the JNI calls the client makes into the platform. Symbol resolution
reads the engine's own ELF imports rather than a checked-in list, so an
ordinary libc import resolves from the host automatically
([`docs/adr/ADR-034-symbol-resolution-asks-the-library.md`](docs/adr/ADR-034-symbol-resolution-asks-the-library.md)).
Compatibility gaps are fixed at that framework layer, never by patching the
binary ([`docs/adr/ADR-001-in-process-hooking.md`](docs/adr/ADR-001-in-process-hooking.md)).

Diagram and data flow: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Install

x86-64 or aarch64 Linux, Wayland. X11 starts through Flatpak's fallback socket
but is not developed further
([`docs/adr/ADR-011-wayland-and-libadwaita.md`](docs/adr/ADR-011-wayland-and-libadwaita.md)).
aarch64 is new and untested on real ARM64 hardware — see
[`docs/multiarch.md`](docs/multiarch.md) for what has and has not been
checked. The Arch package is x86-64 only; Arch Linux itself does not build for
aarch64.

You also need Roblox's Android build. Cordial does not ship it. First run has a
**Download Roblox** button that fetches it from APKPure and refuses anything
not signed by Roblox's own certificate. If [Sober](https://sober.vinegarhq.org/)
is installed, Cordial uses the APK already on disk without copying or modifying
it. You can also point Cordial at your own APK in Settings.

**Flatpak:**

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists cordial https://luohoa97.github.io/cordial/cordial.flatpakrepo
flatpak install cordial io.github.luohoa97.Cordial
flatpak run io.github.luohoa97.Cordial
```

The remote is not signed: `flatpak install` proves the download matches the
repository's checksums, not who built it
([`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md#trust-and-what-not-signed-means)).

There are two branches. `master` rebuilds on every commit. `stable` moves only
on a tagged release — it is created by the first tagged build to run through
the release workflow, so until then a plain `flatpak install` lands on
`master`. Once `stable` exists:

```bash
flatpak uninstall io.github.luohoa97.Cordial//master
flatpak install cordial io.github.luohoa97.Cordial//stable
```

**AppImage**, from the [releases page](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/releases).
Newer and less proven than the Flatpak; its web-view path fix has been measured
on a stand-in, not on a real machine without WebKitGTK, and not outside Fedora
([`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md#appimage)):

```bash
chmod +x Cordial-*.AppImage && ./Cordial-*.AppImage   # -x86_64 or -aarch64
```

**Packages** from the releases page. All artefacts are cosign-signed. The
apt/dnf/pacman *repositories* are not published — the build scripts refuse to
produce an unsigned repository. AUR submission is blocked on account sign-ups
being closed.

```bash
sudo apt install ./cordial_*_amd64.deb      # or _arm64.deb
sudo dnf install ./cordial-*.x86_64.rpm     # or .aarch64.rpm
sudo pacman -U cordial-*-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst # x86-64 only -- see above
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial
cd cordial
cargo build --release
```

Needs Clang — AOSP bionic uses C11 `_Atomic` in C++ headers and GCC rejects it
— plus GTK4 >= 4.10 and libadwaita >= 1.4 development packages. PipeWire and
WebKitGTK-6.0 headers are optional and probed at build time; without them the
binary is quietly less capable. The Nix flake has not been built successfully
by anyone. Full list: [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md#building-from-source).

## Configuration

**FastFlags** live in `~/.local/share/cordial/profiles/<profile>/flags.json`, or
wherever `CORDIAL_FLAGS` points. Layering and syntax:
[`docs/fastflags.md`](docs/fastflags.md).

**Mouse acceleration** is a Settings control — cursor only, or cursor and
camera — stored in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cordial/shell.json`.

**Separate data roots** per instance come from `XDG_DATA_HOME`, which moves both
the profile root and the client's data directory. `CORDIAL_PROFILE_ROOT` moves
only the profile root and not the client.

**Plugins** install from a `.tar.zst` archive through **Settings → Get Plugins**
and unpack to `~/.local/share/cordial/plugins/<id>/`. They run as separate
processes on Deno with named capabilities, default-deny, granted per profile in
`plugin-grants.json`. Three ship with Cordial and all are off until enabled.
Installing, updating, removing, enabling, disabling or granting one reaches an
already-running client within a second or two, no restart needed.
[`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md),
[`docs/adr/ADR-007-host-resources-are-brokered.md`](docs/adr/ADR-007-host-resources-are-brokered.md),
[`docs/adr/ADR-038-plugin-hot-swap.md`](docs/adr/ADR-038-plugin-hot-swap.md).

Runtime knobs — monitor, resolution, DPI scale, frame pacing, pointer lock,
controller glyphs — are environment variables listed in
[`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md).

## What Cordial is not

**Not affiliated with Roblox Corporation**, not endorsed by it, and not
approved by it. Roblox does not support third-party clients and bans accounts
for using them, in waves, including false positives. If your account matters to
you, do not use it here.

**Does not ship Roblox's client.** You supply the Android build.

**Not a cheat, exploit or mod injector.** There is no script execution, no
hooking and no memory access into the Roblox process — absent from the API
rather than disabled, so there is no primitive to re-enable in a fork
([`docs/adr/ADR-001-in-process-hooking.md`](docs/adr/ADR-001-in-process-hooking.md),
[`docs/adr/ADR-003-plugin-isolation.md`](docs/adr/ADR-003-plugin-isolation.md)).
Requests for it are declined. Plugins extend Cordial, not Roblox.

Also permanently out of scope: client-side integrity flags, watermarks, and
obfuscation-as-security.

## Licence

GPL-3.0-or-later. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Third-party components keep their own licences, reproduced in
[`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md): `third_party/libbadcpu`
(MIT, from Sober OSS), `third_party/mocktail-webview` (Apache-2.0, from
mocktail), `mcpelauncher-linker` (MIT), AOSP bionic (Apache-2.0 and BSD),
`libjnivm` (MIT).

**Sober** is why anyone believes a Roblox client can run natively on Linux. Its
public issue tracker is a research corpus here
([`docs/adr/ADR-017-sober-issue-corpus.md`](docs/adr/ADR-017-sober-issue-corpus.md))
and watching it run corrected a claim made here about text input. Sober's code
was never read; it is not source-available.

**mocktail** is Apache-2.0 and settled more here than a line in a list conveys:
the web-view policy is derived from it, the permission bridge follows its
discovery pattern, the Settings performance tables are adapted from its own,
and it established the field order of Roblox's `NativeTextBoxInfo` along with
several flag values. Each is credited at the point of use.
