# Patches against the vendored loader

`third_party/mcpelauncher-linker` and its own nested `bionic` are submodules
pointing at `github.com/minecraft-linux`, which this project cannot push to. A
change made inside them can be committed locally, but the submodule pointer would
then name a commit nobody else can fetch, and a fresh clone would fail. So
changes to the loader live here as patches until somebody decides to fork.

**What is at stake is the instrument, not the behaviour.** 0002, 0003 and 0004
are gated on environment variables that default off, and 0001 only tightens a
mapping, so a release built from a fresh checkout behaves the same whether or
not any of them is applied. What a lost working tree destroys is the ability to
reproduce a measurement. That nearly happened: 132 lines of edits to the three
files `crates/cordial-linker-sys/build.rs` compiles sat uncommitted for an
unknown length of time before anything captured them.

A second copy of those same 132 lines used to live at `third_party/patches/`,
as one undifferentiated blob with a README describing only the two traces in it
and not the mapping change or the constructor split it also carried. It has been
removed: its content is exactly these four patches, checked line for line before
it went.

**These are not applied automatically.** Applying them is a build-system change
nobody has made yet, and a patch that silently applies is worse than one that
does not: `crates/cordial-linker-sys/build.rs` did not watch the loader sources
until recently, so a loader change that failed to take produced a binary that
behaved exactly as though it had never been written. Apply by hand:

```bash
git -C third_party/mcpelauncher-linker/bionic apply ../../../patches/0001-map-engine-text-read-only.patch
```

## 0001 — map the engine's text read-only

`ElfReader::LoadSegments` mapped every `PT_LOAD` with `prot | PROT_WRITE`,
unconditionally, regardless of the segment's own `p_flags`, and nothing ever took
the write bit off again: `_phdr_table_set_load_prot` has its body wrapped in
`#if 0`, and both callers of `phdr_table_protect_segments` are inside
`#if !defined(__LP64__)`. So on x86-64 the engine's 106 MB of text sat `rwxp` for
the life of the process.

That matters because [ADR-001](../docs/adr/ADR-001-in-process-hooking.md) makes
in-process hooking *absent* rather than disabled, precisely so that a fork cannot
extract the primitive — and a fork is currently building a script executor on
Cordial. Writable text hands that fork a foothold that does not even need an
`mprotect` first. Sealing it does not make patching impossible; it stops Cordial
shipping the capability pre-armed.

Checked before changing it: `libroblox.so` has no `TEXTREL`/`DF_TEXTREL` and no
`.rela.dyn`; its only relocations are 546 `.rela.plt` entries, all landing in the
writable data segment. `libbadcpu`'s SIGILL emulator only reads instruction
operands and never writes into the faulting code.

Verified with `tools/engine-text-diff.py`, before and after, on the same build:

    before   7f99b8500000-7f99befa9000 rwxp    DIFFERING BYTES: 0
    after    7feb80500000-7feb86fa9000 r-xp    DIFFERING BYTES: 0

and the client still reaches `app ready` with no crash.

## 0002 — trace guest `dlopen`/`dlsym`

Inert unless `CORDIAL_TRACE_DLSYM=1`, matching the existing `CORDIAL_TRACE_DLOPEN`
convention. It exists because a question about what the engine looks up at runtime
had been answered by inference twice, and this answers it by observation.

What it established, over three identical runs to `app ready`: the engine makes
exactly five `dlopen` calls (`libc.so`, `libcamera2ndk.so`, `libmediandk.so`,
`libvulkan.so.1`, `libandroid.so`) and seven `dlsym` calls (`getauxval`,
`vkGetInstanceProcAddr`, five `AThermal_*`). **Nothing mimalloc-shaped is ever
looked up** — see `crates/cordial-runtime/src/mimalloc_lib.rs` for why that
matters and what it rules out.

## 0003 — split-phase `dlopen`, for testing whether libroblox.so's own
## constructors can be deferred past Cordial's directory setup

Inert unless something calls the two new exports it adds
(`mcpelauncher_defer_next_ctors`, `mcpelauncher_run_deferred_ctors`) — nothing
in the default load path does; `cordial-run` only reaches them behind
`CORDIAL_DEFER_CTORS=1` / `CORDIAL_DEFER_PAST_SETTINGS=1` in
`crates/cordial-runtime/src/bin/load.rs`. Exists to test the question
`docs/analysis/flag-init.md` §26.1 leaves open: can `RbxStorage::init`'s
constructor-time call be pushed past the point where Cordial has told the
engine anything, and does that change its outcome.

Splits `do_dlopen`'s existing two steps — `find_library` (map, relocate) then
`si->call_constructors()` — so a caller can run the first, do its own setup
against the mapped-and-relocated (but not yet constructed) object, then
explicitly trigger the second. `soinfo::call_constructors()` is already
idempotent (guarded by `constructors_called`), so `mcpelauncher_run_
deferred_ctors` calling it late is exactly as safe as bionic's own recursive
calls into it.

**What it established, §27 of `docs/analysis/flag-init.md` has the full
record:** deferring past Cordial's four `NativeSettingsInterface` directory
setters is coherent — no crash, three plain runs and one lldb-instrumented
run, all clean — but changes nothing: `RbxStorage::init`'s empty-path failure
reproduces identically, meaning the directories were never the missing input.
Deferring further, past `nativeInitClientSettings`, is **not** coherent: it
segfaults deterministically (fault address `0x10`, a null-pointer-shaped
dereference, 2/2 plain runs plus a captured backtrace confirming the fault is
inside the native itself, not the calling code) — that native depends on
state only libroblox.so's own constructors set up, so Android's actual
ordering (settings before storage) cannot be reproduced this way from
outside the engine.

## 0004 — an Android-shaped library path, and tracing `dladdr`/`dl_iterate_phdr`

Two additions, both inert unless something calls the new export or sets the
new trace variable. `linker.cpp` gets `mcpelauncher_set_realpath`, which
overwrites a loaded library's `soinfo::realpath_` — pure metadata, no
reopening, no remapping — callable between `mcpelauncher_defer_next_ctors`
and `mcpelauncher_run_deferred_ctors` from patch 0003, so the override is in
place before any constructor-time code that asks the linker "what is my own
path". `libdl.cpp` gets `CORDIAL_TRACE_DLADDR=1`, tracing every `dladdr()`
call with its argument and result, and every `dl_iterate_phdr()` call (call
site only — the per-entry `dlpi_name` goes to the caller's own callback,
which this does not intercept).

Exists to test `docs/analysis/flag-init.md` §31: whether the engine derives
its private data directory by walking up from its own library path the way
an Android app locates `/data/user/0/<pkg>` from `/data/app/<pkg>/lib/<abi>/`.
`crates/cordial-runtime/src/bin/load.rs` wires both together behind
`CORDIAL_ANDROID_LIBPATH=1`: defer `libroblox.so`'s constructors, override its
realpath to an Android-shaped `/data/app/~~.../com.roblox.client-.../lib/
x86_64/libroblox.so`, then run the deferred constructors.

**What it established, §32 of `docs/analysis/flag-init.md` has the full
record: the hypothesis is wrong, and not for lack of trying the right lever.**
`dladdr()` is called **zero** times across two complete 25-second runs to
`app ready: Landing` — the engine never asks the linker this question at all.
`dl_iterate_phdr()` is called, but its first invocation in either run comes
strictly *after* `RbxStorage::init`'s three failing `stat("")` calls, in a
burst of about twenty back-to-back calls consistent with C++ exception
unwinding walking a stack, not with computing a directory beforehand — and
`CORDIAL_TRACE_PATHS=1` shows zero reads of `/proc/self/maps` or
`/proc/self/exe` anywhere in either run, the third route named in the
hypothesis. With the override applied and constructors demonstrably run under
it (no crash, two clean repeats), the failing `stat("")` triple is
byte-for-byte identical to the unmodified baseline. None of the three ways
native code can ask the linker "where am I" are used before, during, or in
place of the failure.
